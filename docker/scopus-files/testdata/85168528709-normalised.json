Existing anesthesia curricula primarily emphasize the acquisition of knowledge, practical skills, and professional competencies, often neglecting the development of intangible skills like tacit knowledge. Despite efforts to establish learning goals through carefully describing competencies, there is a risk of oversimplifying the intricate aspects of professional anesthesia practice. Therefore, the objective of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the genuine curriculum of a specialty training program in anesthesia. This will be achieved by exploring the perceptions of learners with different levels of experience within the program. METHODS: This study employs a phenomenographic research approach to explore the conceptions of anesthesiology trainees and specialists, specifically from a student's perspective, regarding what constitutes an excellent anesthesiologist i.e., what to learn, and the learning process associated with it. RESULTS: This study identified three different conceptions of learning anesthesia within the context of a specialty training program: \"Learning Competencies of Anesthesia,\" \"Learning Work as an Anesthesiologist\" and \"Learning Being an Anesthesiology Professional.\" These conceptions ranged from a relatively instrumental view of education and self-responsibility for learning to a perspective of continuous personal reflection and development integrated with professional interaction. The three conceptions can be described in six dimensions describing the variation in approach to learning and the conceptualization of an anesthesiologist. Relationships between the conceptions and the dimensions were represented in a descriptive framework, showing the hierarchy of increasing understanding. CONCLUSION: This study has uncovered diverse learner perspectives among anesthesiologists at various experience levels concerning their understanding of the role of an anesthesiologist and the associated learning process. These distinct understandings can be categorized into different groups and presented in a descriptive framework that encapsulates the fundamental elements and important educational aspects of an anesthesiologist's progression through a specialty training program in anesthesia. By recognizing and integrating these diverse perspectives, anesthesia education can be enhanced, ultimately resulting in improved preparation of future anesthesia curriculum, teaching and assessments.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168528709"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s12909-023-04573-x"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Hanna", "first_name": "Chin", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58287146900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "\u00c5ke", "first_name": "Ingerman", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6602443930"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Helena Odenstedt", "first_name": "Herg\u00e8s", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57219770989"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
