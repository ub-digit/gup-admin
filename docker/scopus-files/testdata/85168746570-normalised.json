A variety of drugs show weak, moderate or strong anticholinergic effects. Therefore, the cumulative anticholinergic burden should be considered in patients with cognitive impairment. This study aimed to develop a Swedish Anticholinergic Burden Scale (Swe-ABS) to be used in health care and research. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed and Ovid Embase to identify previously published tools quantifying anticholinergic drug burden (i.e., exposure). Drugs and grading scores (0\u20133, no to high anticholinergic activity) were extracted from identified lists. Enteral and parenteral drugs authorized in Sweden were included. Drugs with conflicting scores in the existing lists were assessed by an expert group. Two drugs that were not previously assessed were also added to the evaluation process. Results: The systematic literature search identified the following nine anticholinergic burden scales: Anticholinergic Activity Scale, Anticholinergic Burden Classification, updated Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden scale, Anticholinergic Drug Scale, Anticholinergic Load Scale, Anticholinergic Risk Scale, updated Clinician-rated Anticholinergic Scale, German Anticholinergic Burden Scale and Korean Anticholinergic Burden Scale. A list of drugs with significant anticholinergic effects provided by The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare was included in the process. The suggested Swe-ABS consists of 104 drugs scored as having weak, moderate or strong anticholinergic effects. Two hundred and fifty-six drugs were listed as having no anticholinergic effects based on evaluation in previous scales. In total, 62 drugs were assessed by the expert group. Conclusions: Swe-ABS is a simplified method to quantify the anticholinergic burden and is easy to use in clinical practice. Publication of this scale might make clinicians more aware of drugs with anticholinergic properties and patients\u2019 total anticholinergic burden. Further research is needed to validate the Swe-ABS and evaluate anticholinergic exposure versus clinically significant outcomes.", "keywords": "Anticholinergic, Anticholinergic adverse effects, Anticholinergic burden, Anticholinergic scales, Cognitive impairment, Geriatrics, Muscarinic cholinergic antagonists, Sweden", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168746570"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s12877-023-04225-1"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60118587", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper, Malm\u00f6", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Malmo", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "130122425", "scopus-affilname": "Memory Clinic", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Angelholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Tanja", "first_name": "Rube", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0009-0001-6611-8402"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58548482900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "100582792", "scopus-affilname": "Clinical Pharmacological Laboratory", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Astrid", "first_name": "Ecorcheville", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58548483000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60118587", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper, Malm\u00f6", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Malmo", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60012311", "scopus-affilname": "Karolinska Institutet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "130122425", "scopus-affilname": "Memory Clinic", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Angelholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Elisabet", "first_name": "Londos", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-8192-3354"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "16043272700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60118587", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper, Malm\u00f6", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Malmo", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "126756457", "scopus-affilname": "Primary Healthcare", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Sara", "first_name": "Modig", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-7775-4482"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "25626355700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60000898", "scopus-affilname": "Campus Helsingborg", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Helsingborg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "130122425", "scopus-affilname": "Memory Clinic", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Angelholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Per", "first_name": "Johansson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-0073-7654"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58548210500"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
