Today, access to online medical information has become easier than ever before. There is a stream of research interested in understanding how online health information intervenes and influences the patient-physician relationship. While many studies have focused on patients' online health information seeking, fewer studies have addressed how physicians seek and use online medical information. In this qualitative study, focus groups using clinical scenarios were conducted to examine why and when resident physicians turn to search engines like Google for medical information seeking at the point of care. The paper provides insights in physicians' perceptions and experiences of using digital tools for information seeking during patient consultations. Specifically, we identify and discuss information-seeking strategies of physicians during the patient consultation, contributing crucial knowledge for improving the quality of healthcare and patient outcomes.", "keywords": "Digitalization, healthcare, information seeking, residency education", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164233310"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3233/SHTI230563"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
