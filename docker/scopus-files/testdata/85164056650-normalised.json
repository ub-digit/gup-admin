However, the precise underlying mechanism by which regular exercise therapy (ET) exert effects on the immune system in KOA patients is unknown. Objectives: The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the basal and acute effects of ET on inflammatory biomarkers and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in KOA patients. Methods: PubMed, Web Of Science and PEDro were systematically searched for appropriate studies. If possible, a meta-analysis was performed or an approximation of the effect size (ES) was calculated. Risk of bias was scored using the Cochrane ROB 2.0 or ROBINS-tools. Results: Twenty-one studies involving 1374 participants were included. Fifteen articles focused on basal exercise effects, four on acute effects, and two on both. Biomarker analysis (n=18) was performed in synovial fluid (n=4) or serum/plasma (n=17). A meta-analysis demonstrated that basal CRP was reduced in KOA patients 6-18 weeks weeks after ET (MD: -0.17;95%CI[-0.31;-0.03]), while IL-6 (MD: 0.21;95%CI[-0.44;0.85]), and TNF-\u03b1 (MD: -0.57;95%CI[-1.47;0.32]), levels did not significantly change. Also, sTNFR1/2 did not change significantly after ET. For other biomarkers, insufficient data were available to perform a meta-analysis. Nevertheless, a low degree of evidence was found for a decrease in IL-6 (ES:-0.596 & -0.259 & -0.513), an increase in sTNFR1 (ES:2.325), a decrease in sTNFR2 (ES:-0.997) and an increase in BDNF (ES:1.412). Locally, intra-articular IL-10 (ES:9.163) increased, and IL1\u03b2 (ES:-6.199) and TNF-\u03b1 decreased (ES:-2.322) after ET. An acute exercise session elicited a myokine response (ES IL-6:0.314), and an increase in BDNF (no ES-data). No inflammatory effect (ES CRP:0.052; ES TNF-\u03b1:-0.019 & 0.081) following an acute bout of training was found. However, a single bout of exercise elicited a decrease in intra-articular IL-10 (no ES-data). Conclusion: ET can induce circulatory and intra-articular anti-inflammatory effects in patients with KOA. The antiinflammatory properties have important implications for informing these patients and clinicians about the underlying effects of ET.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164056650"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
