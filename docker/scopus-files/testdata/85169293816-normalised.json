METHODS: We studied 552 562 cases with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 in the Swedish registry of communicable diseases, and 5985 cases with severe COVID-19 based on hospital admissions from October 2020 to December 2021. Four population controls were assigned the index dates of their corresponding cases. We linked job histories to job-exposure matrices to assess the odds for different transmission dimensions and different occupations. We used adjusted conditional logistic analyses to estimate odds ratios (OR) for severe COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The highest OR for severe COVID-19 were for: regular contact with infected patients, (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.23-1.54), close physical proximity (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.34-1.61), and high exposure to diseases or infections (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.52-1.96). Mostly working outside had lower OR (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.57-1.06). The odds for SARS-CoV-2 when mostly working outside were similar (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.80-0.86). The occupation with the highest OR for severe COVID-19 (compared with low-exposure occupations) was certified specialist physician (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.31-3.21) among women and bus and tram drivers (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.49-2.79) among men. CONCLUSIONS: Contact with infected patients, close proximity and crowded workplaces increase the risks for severe COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outdoor work is associated with decreased odds for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169293816"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.5271/sjweh.4103"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Kjell", "first_name": "Tor\u00e9n", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7005580068"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Maria", "first_name": "Albin", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7005057447"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Tomas", "first_name": "Bergstr\u00f6m", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58556607000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Nicola", "first_name": "Murgia", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "8894561000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Magnus", "first_name": "Alderling", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "14059606500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Linus", "first_name": "Schi\u00f6ler", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "24477849700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "Maria", "first_name": "\u00c5berg", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7006094707"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
