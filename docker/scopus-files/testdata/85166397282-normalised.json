Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors could potentially improve cardiac remodelling and clinical outcomes after SAVR. Methods: All patients undergoing SAVR due to aortic stenosis in Sweden 2006-2020 and surviving 6 months after surgery were included. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs; all-cause mortality, stroke or myocardial infarction). Secondary endpoints included the individual components of MACE and cardiovascular mortality. Time-updated adjusted Cox regression models were used to compare patients with and without RAS inhibitors. Subgroup analyses were performed, as well as a comparison between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Results: A total of 11 894 patients (mean age, 69.5 years, 40.4% women) were included. Median follow-up time was 5.4 (2.7-8.5) years. At baseline, 53.6% of patients were dispensed RAS inhibitors, this proportion remained stable during follow-up. RAS inhibition was associated with a lower risk of MACE (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.87 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.93), p<0.001), mainly driven by a lower risk of all-cause death (aHR 0.79 (0.73 to 0.86), p<0.001). The lower MACE risk was consistent in all subgroups except for those with mechanical prostheses (aHR 1.07 (0.84 to 1.37), p for interaction=0.040). Both treatment with ACE inhibitors (aHR 0.89 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.97)) and ARBs (0.87 (0.81 to 0.93)) were associated with lower risk of MACE. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that medical therapy with an RAS inhibitor after SAVR is associated with a 13% lower risk of MACE and a 21% lower risk of all-cause death.", "keywords": "aortic valve stenosis, clinical, epidemiology, pharmacology", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166397282"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1136/heartjnl-2023-322922"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
