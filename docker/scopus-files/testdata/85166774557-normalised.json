The study makes use of the air-raid shelter at Halvtumsgatan 3 in Gothenburg and interviews are conducted with its tenants, the landlord of the apartment building, as well as a local politician currently part of the municipality council. The text applies a theoretical framework based on post-colonial theories such as Homi Bhabha\u2019s Encounter and Third-Space theories, and it is stressed that a change in the relationship between civilians, the shelter and Sweden\u2019s national foreign policy is the result of the encounter between both Ukraine and Russia. This result is attained by focusing on the case study Halvtumsgatan 3, through interviews, and observing policy changes from the Swedish government.", "keywords": "cold war, conflict archaeology, contemporary archaeology, encounter, Shelter, third-space theory", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166774557"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/15740773.2023.2242431"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Adam", "first_name": "Andersson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57322399000"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
