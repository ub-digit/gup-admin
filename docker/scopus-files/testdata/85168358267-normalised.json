The encoded\u00a0HLA-B proteins are pivotal in antigen presentation to cytotoxic T cells, and some variants containing a Bw4 motif also serve as ligands to the killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) 3DL1/S1 of NK cells. We investigated the potential impact of HLA-B genotypes on the efficacy of immunotherapy for relapse prevention in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Seventy-eight non-transplanted AML patients receiving HDC/IL-2 in the post-consolidation phase were genotyped for HLA-B and KIR genes. HLA-B*44 heralded impaired LFS (leukemia-free survival) and overall survival (OS), but the negative association with outcome was not shared across alleles of the HLA-B44 supertype. Notably, HLA-B*44 is one of few HLA-B44 supertype alleles containing a Bw4 motif with a threonine at position 80, which typically results in weak binding to the inhibitory NK receptor, KIR3DL1. Accordingly, a strong interaction between KIR3DL1 and Bw4 was associated with superior LFS and OS (p = 0.014 and p = 0.027, respectively). KIR3DL1+ NK cells from 80\u00a0T-Bw4 donors showed significantly lower degranulation responses and cytokine responses than NK cells from 80I-Bw4 donors, suggesting impaired KIR3DL1-mediated education in 80\u00a0T-Bw4 subjects. We propose that presence of a strong KIR3DL1+\u2013Bw4 interaction improves NK cell education and thus is advantageous in AML patients receiving HDC/IL-2 immunotherapy for relapse prevention.", "keywords": "AML, Histamine, HLA-B*44, IL-2, KIR3DL1, NK cells", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168358267"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s00262-023-03506-3"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
