An overview of research focussed on older adults\u2019 occupations in heat waves can be useful for occupational therapy practice. Objective: To identify what the literature shows about older adults\u2019 experience and performance of, and participation in, occupations in heat waves. Material and method: This scoping review included a literature search in five academic databases, four databases for grey literature, and a manual search. Literature in English regarding older adults 60+ and their occupations in heat waves were eligible. Findings: Twelve studies were included. Findings showed that older adults adapt their occupations using bodily, environmental, and social interaction strategies and by changing their daily routines. Personal, environmental, social, and economic factors facilitate and maintain occupations in heat waves. Conclusion: Older adults adapt their occupations in heat waves and different factors impact how they can be adapted. Future research is needed to explore how older adults experience their occupations in heat waves, and to deepen the knowledge about their heat-adaptive strategies. Significance: The findings support the role of occupational therapists in the design and practice of interventions managing the impact of heat waves in daily life.", "keywords": "Activities of daily living, aged, climate change, elderly, extreme heat, occupational science, occupational therapy", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164516880"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/11038128.2023.2231165"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
