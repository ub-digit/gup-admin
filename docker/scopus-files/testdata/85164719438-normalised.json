Here, we explored a Ca-EDTA combination with aztreonam or ceftazidime-avibactam in vitro and in vivo against diverse CPKp clinical isolates. The synergy testing of this study demonstrated that novel aztreonam-Ca-EDTA or ceftazidime-avibactam-Ca-EDTA combination was significantly effective in eliminating planktonic and mature biofilms in vitro, as well as eradicating CPKp infections in vivo. Both combinations revealed significant therapeutic efficacies in reducing bacterial load in internal organs and protecting treated mice from mortality. Conclusively, this is the first in vitro and in vivo study to demonstrate that novel aztreonam-Ca-EDTA or ceftazidime-avibactam-Ca-EDTA combinations provide favorable efficacy and safety for successful eradication of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae planktonic and biofilm infections.", "keywords": "Biological sciences, Health sciences, Immunology, Medical microbiology, Medical specialty, Medicine, Microbiology", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164719438"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.isci.2023.107215"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
