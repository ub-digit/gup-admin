R. China. The sex pheromone of D. jingyuanensis was shown to be the propionate ester of 3,7-dimethyl-2-tridecanol. Virgin females contained an approximate 1:3 blend of the pheromone precursors erythro-(2S,3S,7R/S and 2R,3R,7R/S)-3,7-dimethyl-2-tridecanol and threo-(2S,3R,7R/S and 2R,3S,7R/S)-3,7-dimethyl-2-tridecanol, but the exact stereoisomers were not determined. Males responded the strongest to the propionate ester of the two threo-isomers, (2S,3R,7R) and (2S,3R,7S), in electroantennogram (EAG) recordings, followed by a significant EAG response to the (2S,3R,7R) propionate of diprionol (pheromone component of D. similis), whereas the remaining two isomers (2S,3S,7S and 2S,3S,7R) of the propionate ester of 3,7-dimethyl-2-tridecanol and the acetate of the (2S,3R,7R) isomer (one of the two pheromone components of D. pini) did not elicit any significant increase in antennal response. In the field, the strongly EAG-active (2S,3R,7R)-isomer alone was only weakly (but significantly) attractive to D. jingyuanensis males at 100 \u00b5g, while the equally EAG- active (2S,3R,7S)-isomer alone at the same loading was 8\u201314 times more attractive than was the (2S,3R,7R)-isomer alone. Traps baited with the same amounts of the two threo-isomers ((2S,3R,7R) and (2S,3R,7S), 100 \u00b5g + 100 \u00b5g) caught significantly more males than did traps baited with other isomers, either of the two isomers alone or other proportions of the two isomers. Thus, the (2S,3R,7S)-isomer is considered as a strong and essential sex-attractant component for D. jingyuanensis males, whereas the (2S,3R,7R)-isomer is a weak but synergistic sex-attractant. This is one of the few examples of a pine sawfly responding significantly stronger to a binary blend of stereoisomers in a synergistic fashion than to a single stereoisomer alone.", "keywords": "3,7-dimethyl-2-tridecanol, attractant, Diprionidae, electroantennography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, Hymenoptera, sex pheromone", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164176910"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/f14061187"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
