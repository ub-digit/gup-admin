This study aimed to summarise the current evidence for the effectiveness and safety of exercise training interventions in patients with rTOF. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, Scopus and reference lists of relevant articles were searched for prospective studies published by November 2021. Random-effects meta-analysis and descriptive synthesis were performed to assess the effectiveness and safety of exercise training in patients with rTOF. RESULTS: Of the 9677 citations identified, 12 articles were included that reported on 10 unique studies and covered 208 patients with rTOF (range of mean/median age: 7.4-43.3 years). All studies implemented 2 to 7 aerobic or respiratory training sessions per week with durations ranging from 6 to 26 weeks. Meta-analysis of the included randomised controlled trials showed that exercise training was associated with a significant improvement in peak VO2 (pooled mean difference: +3.1\u2009mL/min/kg; 95% CI: 0.76 to 5.36\u2009mL/min/kg, p=0.019). Cardiac imaging studies revealed no subclinical adverse remodelling after the exercise interventions. No serious adverse events including arrhythmias were reported in these studies. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that exercise training can improve exercise capacity in patients with rTOF with a low risk for adverse events. Exercise prescription may be a safe and effective tool to help improving outcomes in patients with rTOF.
