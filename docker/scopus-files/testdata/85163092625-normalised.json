In theory, the V-Model should reduce redundant testing and prevent gaps in verification. To assess whether such benefits translate in practice, in a case study at Scania CV AB, we have developed a framework to identify redundancies and gaps in test cases across V-model test levels.Our framework identified both redundancies and gaps in Sca-nia's scripted testing efforts. Deviating cases were also identified where, e.g., requirements were outdated or contained incorrect details. Factors contributing to redundancy include re-verification in a new context, difficulties mapping requirements across levels, and lack of test case documentation. Both redundancies and gaps result from a lack of communication and traceability of test results across test levels. We recommend active collaboration across levels, as well as use of coverage matrices to alleviate these issues. We offer our framework to help refine testing practices and to inspire process improvements.", "keywords": "Automotive Software, Embedded System, Software Testing, Testing Process, Traceability", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163092625"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1109/ICSTW58534.2023.00035"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
