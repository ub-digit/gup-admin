Hereby, renewable energy - especially considering the current European energy crisis - such as solar energy will play an increasing role. To promote a more extensive use of solar energy and thus contributing to a faster energy transition, it is valuable to engage all citizens, not least children. How can real-time visualization of solar energy production in learning environments contribute to increased understanding of energy production and consumption? Educational environments can be a powerful platform to cultivate an interest in more environmentally and sustainable behaviour at an early age. However, energy is intangible, abstract, and difficult to grasp for non-experts. Digital tools incorporating energy visualization may be able to facilitate an increased understanding of energy units and measurements. The City of Gothenburg, Sweden, has the ambition to place photovoltaics on all roofs of schools and kindergartens, a process that is already in progress. The solar energy production is measured in real-time and only used for building operation management. This paper presents a study that develops a concept for a digital and educational visualization tool for school children aged 9 to 12, with the goal to engage, facilitate a lasting learning outcome, and awaken curiosity in solar energy. A prototype of a real-time visualization tool was developed, which in a playful way visualises the solar electricity production of the school property and compares it to the energy consumption of everyday activities, displayed on a centrally placed screen in the school. It was installed in four pilot schools and evaluated with 233 pupils. Results indicate several potentials of the visualization: to communicate local solar energy production to pupils, triggering thoughts, ideas, and a will to continue to learn more about solar energy production.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166597142"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1088/1755-1315/1196/1/012083"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60000990", "scopus-affilname": "Chalmers University of Technology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "L.", "first_name": "Zachrisson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58520263000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60000990", "scopus-affilname": "Chalmers University of Technology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "B.", "first_name": "Stahre Wastberg", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57196467108"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "130035145", "scopus-affilname": "Boid Design Studio", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "A.", "first_name": "Engstrom", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58519671400"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "125499276", "scopus-affilname": "Local Premises Administration", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "L.", "first_name": "Beneduce", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58520700200"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60000990", "scopus-affilname": "Chalmers University of Technology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "C.", "first_name": "Larsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58499758000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60000990", "scopus-affilname": "Chalmers University of Technology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "L.", "first_name": "Thuvander", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "14323749200"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
