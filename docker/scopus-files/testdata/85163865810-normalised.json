It does so through textual references to the 1883 play R\u00e4ddad (Saved) by the Swedish female playwright Alfhild Agrell. By taking the point of departure in Helen Freshwater\u2019s idea of an inclusive model of censorship, Judith Butler\u2019s theory of reiteration, and Toril Moi\u2019s claims of the political potential of a reading mode starting in the concerns of the text, I establish the theoretical basis for a complicit reading strategy. I then present the gendered period-specific censorious situation of the 1880s in Sweden, in which the aesthetics of idealism influenced censorship in the theatres and also regulated playwriting. I demonstrate a vacillation between self-censoring and exposing themes of intimacy in Agrell\u2019s play, proposing that this should be regarded as a specific rhetoric produced by an awareness of gendered censorship. Finally, by leaning on phenomenological and new materialist instruments of analysis, I present an embodied reading strategy for Agrell\u2019s play in response to its specific individual poetics and concerns, to expose its full gender/feminist potential.", "keywords": "Agrell, Alfhild, censorship, feminist literary criticism, intimacy, self-censorship, Swedish drama, women\u2019s writing", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163865810"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3986/pkn.v46.i1.02"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
