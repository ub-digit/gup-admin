How 3D genome architecture affects transcriptional plasticity and its interaction with genetic adaptation are unclear. We transplanted estuarine oysters to a new environment and found that genes located in active chromatin regions exhibited greater transcriptional plasticity, and changes in these regions were negatively correlated with selective signals. This indicates a trade-off between 3D active regions and selective signals in shaping plastic responses to a new environment. Specifically, a mutation, lincRNA, and changes in the accessibility of a distal enhancer potentially affect its interaction with the Man\u2161a gene, which regulates the muscle function and survival of oysters. Our findings reveal that 3D genome architecture compensates for the role of genetic adaptation in environmental response to new environments and provide insights into synergetic genetic and epigenetic interactions critical for fitness-related trait and survival in a model marine species.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164243702"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.xinn.2023.100464"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
