Hallmarks of SLE are granulocyte activation, type I interferon (IFN) overproduction, and autoantibodies. Here we examined whether low-density granulocytes (LDG) and granulocyte activation increase during pregnancy, and related the results to IFN\u03b1 protein levels, autoantibody profile, and gestational age at birth. Methods: Repeated blood samples were collected during pregnancy in trimesters one, two, and three from 69 women with SLE and 27 healthy pregnant women (HC). Nineteen of the SLE women were also sampled late postpartum. LDG proportions and granulocyte activation (CD62L shedding) were measured by flow cytometry. Plasma IFN\u03b1 protein concentrations were quantified by single molecule array (Simoa) immune assay. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. Results: Women with SLE had higher LDG proportions and increased IFN\u03b1 protein levels compared to HC throughout pregnancy, but neither LDG fractions nor IFN\u03b1 levels differed during pregnancy compared to postpartum in SLE. Granulocyte activation status was higher in SLE relative to HC pregnancies, and it was increased during pregnancy compared to after pregnancy in SLE. Higher LDG proportions in SLE were associated with antiphospholipid positivity but not to IFN\u03b1 protein levels. Finally, higher LDG proportions in trimester three correlated independently with lower gestational age at birth in SLE. Conclusion: Our results suggest that SLE pregnancy results in increased peripheral granulocyte priming, and that higher LDG proportions late in pregnancy are related to shorter pregnancy duration but not to IFN\u03b1 blood levels in SLE.", "keywords": "Autoantibody(ies), Interferon alpha, Neutrophils, Pregnancy, Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162752452"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s13075-023-03092-w"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
