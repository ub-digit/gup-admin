The drinking water from one of the two waterworks in Ronneby, Sweden, was heavily contaminated for decades with PFAS from firefighting foams, primarily perfluorohexane sulfonic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 offered a unique opportunity to investigate antibody responses to primary vaccination in adults who had been exposed to PFAS. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to evaluate associations between PFAS, across a wide range of exposure levels, and antibody responses in adults 5 wk and 6 months after a two-dose vaccination regime against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Adults age 20-60 y from Ronneby (formula presented , median PFOS serum level formula presented , fifth to 95th percentile formula presented ) and a group with background exposure (formula presented , median PFOS serum level formula presented ) received two doses of the Spikevax (Moderna) mRNA vaccine. The levels of seven PFAS were measured in serum before vaccination. Serum immunoglobulin G antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen (S-Abs) were measured before vaccination and at 5 wk (formula presented ) and 6 months (formula presented ) after the second vaccine dose. Linear regression analyses were fitted against current, historical, and prenatal exposure to PFAS, adjusting for sex, age, and smoking, excluding individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2-infection. RESULTS: PFAS exposure, regardless of how it was estimated, was not negatively associated with antibody levels 5 wk [current PFOS: formula presented S-Abs/PFOS interquartile range (IQR); 95% confidence interval (CI): formula presented , 7] or 6 months (current PFOS: 3% S-Abs/PFOS IQR; 95% CI: formula presented , 12) after COVID-19 vaccination. DISCUSSION: Following a strict study protocol, rigorous study design, and few dropouts, we found no indication that PFAS exposure negatively affected antibody responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination for up to 6 months after vaccination. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11847.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168190915"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1289/EHP11847"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
