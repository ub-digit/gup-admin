In this review, we discuss the characteristics of the AO that favors transport of pollutants from lower latitudes to the AO. We point out how important the physical qualities of the pollutants are, which routes they are taking into the AO, if by water currents, air or by rivers, and how they are circulating within the AO and entering the biological food web. It is based on knowledge we have on geography, air and water currents, water masses and the biological communities. Ice and ice cover are given special attention, both as a physical barrier for water/air exchange and how ice cover production affects the concentration of pollutants. By using examples from well-known pollutants (e.g., legacy organochlorine pesticides, currently used pesticides and mercury), we show, from measured field data, how these factors determine the distribution of pollutants and will summarize what can be learned from the analysis of contents in animals (birds, mammals and fish). We present assessments of the biological, chemical and physical effects the pollutants have. The paper finishes with a description of the new threats that are to be expected by new pollution sources related to climate change that opens passages for expanding traffic and exploration in the AO.", "keywords": "Arctic Ocean (AO), BioConcentration Factor (BCF), Fugacity, Mercury, Ocean circulation, Persistand Organic Pollutants (POP), Pesticides, Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), Sea ice, Transport routes", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164756396"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/978-3-030-75602-4_5"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
