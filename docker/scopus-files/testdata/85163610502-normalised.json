Inspired by the cellular cooperativity of proteins, we have taken a step forward to address this challenge by cohabitating Immunoglobulin G (IgG1) with a food protein gelatin in the solid-state at room temperature. Interestingly, IgG1 remained functionally active for a record 14 months revealed from the western-blot assay. Further quantification by HP-LC analysis showed 100% structural integrity of IgG1 with no degradation in the gelatin matrix during this period. The developed formulation has a direct application in oral medical nutrition therapy to cure gastrointestinal microbial infections. Also the strategy provides a robust energy economic alternative to the protein engineering methods for long-term functional storage of therapeutic proteins at room temperature.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163610502"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1039/d3tb00161j"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
