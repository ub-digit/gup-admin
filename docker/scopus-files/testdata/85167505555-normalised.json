A cohort study over 10 years", "pubyear": "2023", "sourcetitle": "BMC Rheumatology", "issn": null, "eissn": null, "sourcevolume": "7", "sourceissue": "1", "sourcepages": null, "articlenumber": "23", "abstract": "Background: Risk of fragility fractures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is increased. Disease-related inflammation in RA is associated with low Bone Mineral Density (BMD). However, effects of specific disease factors on fracture occurrence and whether or not such disease effects are independent of BMD are unknown. Methods: Analysis of fracture outcome in the prospective cohort of 2557 patients with early RA (67% women, mean age 58.1 \u00b1 15.6 years) during an observation period of 10.6 \u00b1 4.7 years. In 602 patients BMD was measured at baseline. The first major fragility fractures were considered. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis, adjusted for traditional factors, prior fracture, disease activity and period of inclusion, were used to estimate the risk of the outcome. Results: During follow-up fracture occurred in 352 patients (13.8%), a rate of 13/1000 p-y. A proportional risk reduction for the outcome was associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) at baseline, BMI \u2265 30\u00a0kg/m2, and over the first two years sustained Disease Activity Score (DAS28)-remission, DAS28-low disease activity and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) \u2264 0.5. The proportional risk elevation for fractures was associated with BMI \u2264 20\u00a0kg/m2, DAS28 at baseline, 6-month and at 1-year, cumulative DAS28 over the two years, RF, erosion score progression at 2-year, HAQ score and HAQ \u2265 1 at 6-month and 1-year and showed a trend for ACPA positivity. The estimated fracture risk was increased in users of glucocorticoids (GC), associated with a higher GC-dosage at follow-ups and a higher cumulative dosage over two years, independently of disease activity. With adjustment for BMD, there was no difference in fracture outcome by exposure to GC. The effects of a higher BMI, DAS28-remission and low HAQ \u2264 0.5 attained at 6-month of treatment initiation and sustained up to 2 years, RF, ACPA, and erosion score progression at 2-year were independent of low BMD. Conclusions: This analysis supports importance of RA-specific risk factors in early RA for future major fragility fractures. Treat-to-target strategy and restored functional capacity in early RA-disease are important to prevent fractures. Autoantibody positivity, progressively erosive disease, and low weight could have additional value for personalized fracture preventive strategies in early RA.", "keywords": "Autoantibody, Body mass index, Bone mineral density, Early rheumatoid arthritis, Erosive disease, Fracture risk, Functional ability, Sustained disease control", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167505555"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s41927-023-00347-6"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60069985", "scopus-affilname": "Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Jette", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Belgium"}, {"scopus-afid": "60012311", "scopus-affilname": "Karolinska Institutet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Sofia", "first_name": "Ajeganova", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "45661144600"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60118584", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper, Lund", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "126182458", "scopus-affilname": "Spenshult Research and Development Center", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Halmstad", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Maria", "first_name": "Andersson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57202712312"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60118584", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper, Lund", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "126182458", "scopus-affilname": "Spenshult Research and Development Center", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Halmstad", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Kristina", "first_name": "Forslind", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6701580918"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Inger", "first_name": "Gjertsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6602236593"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60019063", "scopus-affilname": "Falu lasarett", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Falun", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Britt Marie", "first_name": "Nyh\u00e4ll-W\u00e5hlin", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "12765524900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60118584", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper, Lund", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Bj\u00f6rn", "first_name": "Svensson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58529977700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60019295", "scopus-affilname": "Karolinska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60012311", "scopus-affilname": "Karolinska Institutet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "Ingi\u00e4ld", "first_name": "Hafstr\u00f6m", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7004086285"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
