Whether DM affects the outcome after open trigger finger release (OTFR) in patients with DM is not known. Our aim was thus to explore outcomes after OTFR in patients with type 1 (T1D) and type 2 DM (T2D). Methods: Data included patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) from all OTFRs performed between 2010 and 2020 registered in the Swedish national registry for hand surgery in individuals over 18 years cross-linked with the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR). PROMs included QuickDASH and HQ8, a questionnaire designed for national registry for hand surgery, preoperative and at 3 and 12 months postoperative. HQ8 included pain on load, pain on motion without load, and stiffness. Outcome was calculated using linear-mixed models and presented as means adjusted for age and stratified by sex. Results: In total, 6242 OTFRs were included, whereof 496 had T1D (332, 67% women) and 869 had T2D (451, 52% women). Women with T1D reported more symptoms of stiffness (P < 0.001), and women with T2D reported more pain on load (P < 0.05), motion without load (P < 0.01), and worse overall result at 3 months. At 12 months, however, no differences were found in any of the HQ-8 PROMs among men or women. Women with T2D had slightly higher QuickDASH scores at 3 and 12 months. Conclusion: Patients with T1D and T2D can expect the same results after OTFR as individuals without DM, although the improvement might take longer especially among women with T2D.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163657879"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1097/GOX.0000000000005037"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
