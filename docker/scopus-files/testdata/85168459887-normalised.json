The aims of the current study were to: (1) Describe psychiatric and crime-related characteristics of a large group of offenders with ASD who had undergone a Forensic Psychiatric Investigation (FPI). (2) Identify clinical subgroups among this group of offenders. (3) Investigate associations between the identified clinical subgroups and (a) psychiatric comorbidity (b) types of crimes and (c) criminal responsibility. Methods: The study cohort consists of all subjects (n = 831) who received an ASD-diagnosis at an FPI between 2002 and 2018 in Sweden. Descriptive and clinical, as well as crime related variables were obtained from the FPIs. Non-parametric (Pearson \u03c72, Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U-test) inferential statistics were used for analyses of between-group differences and effect sizes were reported. A Latent Class Analysis was used to identify homogeneous subgroups (or classes) from categorical characteristics. Results: The cohort consisted of 708 men and 123 women, aged 18 to 74 yrs. Two-thirds (66.7%) of the cohort had at least one other psychiatric diagnosis, the most prevalent was substance use disorder (SUD). A severe mental disorder, equivalent to lack of criminal responsibility, was most often reported among offenders with a comorbid diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder. The most common type of crime was violent crime. Three person-oriented clinical subgroups were identified; (1) ASD with few other diagnoses; (2) ASD and very high levels of SUDs, plus moderate levels of other externalizing disorders and psychotic psychopathology and (3) ASD and moderate to high levels of personality disorders (other than ASPD) and SUDs. Conclusion: Our results highlight the importance of all parts of the CJS to be prepared to handle offenders with ASD, often with high levels of additional psychiatric problems. Traditional approaches in treatment or other psychosocial interventions for ASD may need to be adapted to at least three general clinical profiles\u2013 one with mainly neurodevelopmental problems, one with a spectrum of externalizing problems and one with complex personality related difficulties.", "keywords": "Autism Spectrum Disorders, clinical subgroups, crime, criminal responsibility, forensic psychiatric investigation", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168459887"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1168572"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60118782", "scopus-affilname": "Region Sk\u00e5ne", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Kristianstad", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60118584", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper, Lund", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Bj\u00f6rn", "first_name": "Hofvander", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "26632248400"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Thomas", "first_name": "Nilsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55636321722"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Ola", "first_name": "St\u00e5hlberg", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "18134723500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60118584", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper, Lund", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Emma", "first_name": "Claesdotter", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56786317900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60118782", "scopus-affilname": "Region Sk\u00e5ne", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Kristianstad", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Patricia", "first_name": "Moberg", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58543686500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60118584", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper, Lund", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Klara", "first_name": "Ahlb\u00e4ck", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58543686600"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "Malin", "first_name": "Hildebrand Karl\u00e9n", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56436788600"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
