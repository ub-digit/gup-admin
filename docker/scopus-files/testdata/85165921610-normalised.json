Objectives: We explored whether we could detect differentially abundant complement and coagulation proteins in the samples obtained from the small airway lining fluid by collection of exhaled particles in patients with asthma and whether these proteins are associated with small airway dysfunction and asthma control. Method: Exhaled particles were obtained from 20 subjects with asthma and 10 healthy controls (HC) with the PExA method and analysed with the SOMAscan proteomics platform. Lung function was assessed by nitrogen multiple breath washout test and spirometry. Results: 53 proteins associated with the complement and coagulation systems were included in the analysis. Nine of those proteins were differentially abundant in subjects with asthma as compared to HC, and C3 was significantly higher in inadequately controlled asthma as compared to well-controlled asthma. Several proteins were associated with physiological tests assessing small airways. Conclusions: The study highlights the role of the local activation of the complement and coagulation systems in the small airway lining fluid in asthma and their association with both asthma control and small airway dysfunction. The findings highlight the potential of complement factors as biomarkers to identify different sub-groups among patients with asthma that could potentially benefit from a therapeutic approach targeting the complement system.", "keywords": "Asthma, Asthma control, Coagulation, Complement system, Exhaled particles, Small airways", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165921610"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1159/000531374"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Spela", "first_name": "Kokelj", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-5863-057X"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57214136673"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "128717947", "scopus-affilname": "PExA AB", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "J\u00f6rgen", "first_name": "\u00d6stling", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "36766968100"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60003858", "scopus-affilname": "Uppsala Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Uppsala", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Karin", "first_name": "Fromell", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-8905-8791"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "9247615300"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Lowie E.G.W.", "first_name": "Vanfleteren", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-4387-4096"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "26028693900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60000666", "scopus-affilname": "AstraZeneca Sweden", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Sodertalje", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Henric K.", "first_name": "Olsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-5101-8871"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7102556907"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60104372", "scopus-affilname": "Linnaeus University, Kalmar", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Kalmar", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60003858", "scopus-affilname": "Uppsala Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Uppsala", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Kristina", "first_name": "Nilsson Ekdahl", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55664569500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60003858", "scopus-affilname": "Uppsala Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Uppsala", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "Bo", "first_name": "Nilsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "16194953700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "8", "last_name": "Anna Carin", "first_name": "Olin", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-6674-9020"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7005071964"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
