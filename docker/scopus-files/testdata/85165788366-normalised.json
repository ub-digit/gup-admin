A series of 1-day training sessions was arranged involving undergraduate nursing and medical students. Scenarios were designed for practicing teamwork principles and interprofessional communication skills by endorsing active participation by all team members. Methods: Four focus groups occurred 2\u20134\u00a0weeks after the training. Thematic analysis of the transcribed focus groups was applied, guided by questions on what changes in students\u2019 understanding of teamwork and professional roles were identified and how such changes had been achieved. Results: The first question, aiming to identify changes in students\u2019 understanding of teamwork, resulted in three categories: realizing and embracing teamwork fundamentals, reconsidering professional roles, and achieving increased confidence. The second question, regarding how participation in IPSE could support the transformation of students\u2019 understanding of teamwork and of professional roles, embraced another three categories: feeling confident in the learning environment, embodying experiences, and obtaining an outside perspective. Conclusions: This study showed the potential of IPSE to transform students\u2019 understanding of others\u2019 professional roles and responsibilities. Students displayed extensive knowledge on fundamental teamwork principles and what these meant in the midst of participating in the scenarios. A critical prerequisite for the development of these new insights was to feel confident in the learning environment. The significance of how the environment was set up calls for further research on the design of IPSE in influencing role understanding and communicative skills in significant ways.", "keywords": "Communication, Interprofessional, Medical students, Nursing students, Simulation", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165788366"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s41077-017-0041-6"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Lena", "first_name": "Oxelmark", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-8397-7252"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6506125372"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Torben", "first_name": "Nordahl Amor\u00f8e", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57210796915"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Liisa", "first_name": "Carlzon", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56144924900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Hans", "first_name": "Rystedt", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "15737733500"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
