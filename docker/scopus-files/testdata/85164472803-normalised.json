We compared patient understanding, anxiety and decisional quality between two-stage and traditional one-stage consent. Methods: We approached patients at an academic cancer center for a low-stakes trial of a mind\u2013body intervention for procedural distress during prostate biopsy. Patients were randomized to hear about the trial by either one- or two-stage consent (n = 66 vs n = 59). Patient-reported outcomes included Quality of Informed Consent (0\u2013100); general and consent-specific anxiety and decisional conflict, burden, and regret. Results: Quality of Informed Consent scores were non-significantly superior for two-stage consent, by 0.9 points (95% confidence interval = \u22122.3, 4.2, p = 0.6) for objective and 1.1 points (95% CI = \u22124.8, 7.0, p = 0.7) for subjective understanding. Differences between groups for anxiety and decisional outcomes were similarly small. In a post hoc analysis, consent-related anxiety was lower among two-stage control patients, likely because scores were measured close to the time of biopsy in the two-stage patients receiving the experimental intervention. Conclusion: Two-stage consent maintains patient understanding of randomized trials, with some evidence of lowered patient anxiety. Further research is warranted on two-stage consent in higher-stakes settings.", "keywords": "anxiety, clinical protocols, Informed consent, randomized controlled trials, research design, surveys and questionnaires", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164472803"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/17407745231185058"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
