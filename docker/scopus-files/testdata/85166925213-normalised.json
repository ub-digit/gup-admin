In general, estate literature attempts to correct pernicious prejudices about communities centred on the council estate, stereotypes which align classist, racist, and sexist rhetoric to marginalise this population. In addition to locating recent examples of estate literature\u2013Caleb Femi\u2019s, Poor (2020), Anders Lustgarten\u2019s The Seven Acts of Mercy (2016), and Guy Gunaratne\u2019s In Our Mad and Furious City (2018)\u2013amidst this socio-economic context, this paper also identifies the various formal features these works draw upon to generate a collective voice which at once rejects the othering of the council estate while also resisting the temptation to substitute one reductive group identity label for another.
