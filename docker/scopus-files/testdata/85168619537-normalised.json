The aim of this study was to analyze interrater reliability in assessing complications according to the methods in GynOp, and to explore physicians' perceptions of registering complications. Material and methods: A digital survey was sent to gynecologists and residents in gynecology in Sweden. Participating clinics were recruited through the Swedish network for national clinical studies in Obstetrics and Gynecology, SNAKS. Twenty fictional cases, intended to represent normal postoperative course, failure to cure, and varying degrees of complications, were developed by the research group. The clinical scenarios included abdominal and laparoscopic surgery of the uterus and adnexa, vaginal hysterectomies, as well as hysteroscopy. The respondents graded each case on the presence of a complication (yes/no). Type of complication, severity, and what action the complication required according to Clavien-Dindo was registered if a complication was acknowledged, according to the method in GynOp. Interrater reliability and the opinions of the respondents were presented descriptively. More than 80% of respondents making the same assessment was considered as agreement. Results: The response rate was 41%, with 104 responding physicians from 16 gynecological clinics. Type and severity of complication was considered relevant to register by 88% and 89% of respondents, respectively. Agreement on whether the case described a complication was >80% in 85% (17/20) of cases and agreement using the Clavien-Dindo classification was >90% in 80% (16/20) of cases. There was high agreement in assessments of classically severe complications, such as pulmonary embolism and ureteral damage, in both presence of complication and severity, as well as Clavien-Dindo (>90% for all methods). Cases with agreement <80% on whether the case described a complication were bordering between normal postoperative course and minor complication. Conclusions: This study provides validation for the methods used to register complications after gynecological surgery according to the GynOp register, including the use of Clavien-Dindo in gynecology. However, the results indicate a need to define what should be considered symptoms inherent to each type of surgery.", "keywords": "Clavien-Dindo, complications, gynecological surgery, interrater reliability, quality register", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168619537"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/aogs.14661"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031040", "scopus-affilname": "Ume\u00e5 Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Umea", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Elin", "first_name": "Collins", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-6616-5914"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57204709649"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031040", "scopus-affilname": "Ume\u00e5 Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Umea", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Per", "first_name": "Liv", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "37122343700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Annika", "first_name": "Strandell", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-1647-5388"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7003357282"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60012311", "scopus-affilname": "Karolinska Institutet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Sophia", "first_name": "Ehrstr\u00f6m", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "8898777500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Mathias", "first_name": "P\u00e5lsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57193097122"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Anna", "first_name": "Darelius", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57194112345"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "Leonidas", "first_name": "Magarakis", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57193577227"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031040", "scopus-affilname": "Ume\u00e5 Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Umea", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "8", "last_name": "Annika", "first_name": "Idahl", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6504403801"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
