We assessed the clustering of multiple HLBs among 11, 13 and 15-year-old Swedish adolescents and examined the socioeconomic and demographic correlates for the identified clusters. Methods: We used data from the 2017/2018 Swedish Health Behaviour in School-aged children (HBSC) study to conduct sex and age-stratified latent class analysis (LCA). The LCA was based on five HLBs: eating behavior and habits (EBH), physical activity (PA), tobacco usage (TU), alcohol consumption (AC) and sleeping habits and patterns (SHPs). Multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between the identified clusters and the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of adolescents and their parents. Results: Health behaviors varied by sex and age. Four distinct clusters were identified based on sex: cluster 1 (Mixed eating behaviors and habits, physical activity and low alcohol consumption), cluster 2 (Healthy lifestyle behaviors), cluster 3 (Unhealthy lifestyle behaviors), and cluster 4 (Breakfast, low alcohol consumption and tobacco usage). In the age-stratified analyzes, three clusters were identified: cluster 1 (Unhealthy lifestyle behaviors), cluster 2 (Moderately healthy lifestyle behaviors) and cluster 3 (Healthy lifestyle behaviors). The multinomial analysis showed that sex, age, family situation and perceived family wealth were strong predictors of health behaviors. Unhealthy behaviors were most commonly associated with socioeconomic disadvantage, having a migrant background, and living in reconstructed families or single-parent households. Conclusion: Health behaviors vary significantly based on socioeconomic and demographic circumstances. Targeted policies and intervention programs are necessary to improve HLBs among vulnerable and at-risk adolescents.", "keywords": "alcohol, children and adolescents, diet, health behaviors, lifestyle, physical activity, sleep, smoking", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166513915"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3389/fpubh.2023.1178353"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Kenisha Russell", "first_name": "Jonsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57201463856"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Maria", "first_name": "Corell", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57190133841"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Petra", "first_name": "L\u00f6fstedt", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "11141399900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60117061", "scopus-affilname": "Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bremen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Germany"}, {"scopus-afid": "60020661", "scopus-affilname": "University of Liverpool", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Liverpool", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United Kingdom"}, {"scopus-afid": "60008293", "scopus-affilname": "Universit\u00e4t Bremen", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bremen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Germany"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Nicholas Kofi", "first_name": "Adjei", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57193229186"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
