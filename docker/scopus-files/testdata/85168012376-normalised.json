Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is a biomarker reflecting neuro-axonal injury in MS that could be used to monitor disease activity, response to drugs and to prognosticate disease course. Here we show a moderate correlation between sNfL and lymphocyte cell subpopulations, and our data furthermore suggest that sNfL and specific immune cell subpopulations together could predict future disease worsening in MS.", "keywords": "Biomarkers, Disease worsening, Immune cell subset frequencies, Multiple sclerosis, Serum neurofilament light chain", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168012376"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.jneuroim.2023.578175"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
