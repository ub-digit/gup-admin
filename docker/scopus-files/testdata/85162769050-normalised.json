Milne-Edwards, 1869, is described from India using morphological and molecular characters. The new species was collected from the bycatch of the Pazhayar fishing port, which receives trawl catches from the Bay of Bengal, off Tamil Nadu state, in southeastern India. Banareia metiguinotae, new species, is most similar to B. serenei Guinot, 1976, from Vietnam, in the general form and fresh colouration, but it differs mainly in the outline of the carapace, the form of the front, carapace anterolateral margin, ambulatory legs, and the male pleon and gonopods. The morphological description of the new species is further augmented by mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) sequence data. With the description of this new species, 17 species of Banareia are hereby recognised, with four species known from Indian territorial waters.", "keywords": "Banareia metiguinotae, Banareiinae, biodiversity, Decapoda, taxonomy", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162769050"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.26107/RBZ-2023-0029"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
