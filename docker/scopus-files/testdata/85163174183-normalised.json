However, large-scale studies on SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater from low-and middle-income countries is limited because of economic and technical reasons. In this study, wastewater samples were collected twice a month from 186 urban and rural subdistricts in nine provinces of Thailand mostly having decentralized and non-sewered sanitation infrastructure and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA variants using allele-specific RT-qPCR. Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration was used to estimate the real-time incidence and time-varying effective reproduction number (Re). Results showed an increase in SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater from urban and rural areas 14\u201320 days earlier than infected individuals were officially reported. It also showed that community/food markets were \u201chot spots\u201d for infected people. This approach offers an opportunity for early detection of transmission surges, allowing preparedness and potentially mitigating significant outbreaks at both spatial and temporal scales.", "keywords": "Applied microbiology, Environmental monitoring, Molecular microbiology, Virology", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163174183"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.isci.2023.107019"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
