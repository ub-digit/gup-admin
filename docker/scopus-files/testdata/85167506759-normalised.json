Here, we report that high MYC expression stimulates proliferation and protects B lymphoma cells from apoptosis under normal oxidative stress levels and that compounds including N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vitamin C (VitC) induce apoptosis by reducing oxidative stress. NAC and VitC injections effectively reduce tumor growth in lymphoma cells with high MYC expression but not in those with low MYC expression. MYC knockdown confers tumor resistance to NAC and VitC, while MYC activation renders B cells sensitive to these compounds. Mechanistically, NAC and VitC stimulate MYC binding to EGR1 through Cys117 of MYC, shifting its transcriptional output from cell cycle to apoptosis gene expression. These results identify a redox-controlled mechanism for MYC's role in maintaining proliferation and preventing apoptosis, offering a potential therapeutic rationale for evaluating NAC or VitC in patients with MYC-driven B cell lymphoma.", "keywords": "apoptosis, B cell, CP: Cancer, lymphoma, MYC, vitamin C", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167506759"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112961"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
