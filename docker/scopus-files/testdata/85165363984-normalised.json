The aim of this case\u2013control study was to explore potential differences in circulating miRNAs in young individuals with long-duration type 1 diabetes (T1D) compared to healthy controls, and how identified miRNAs are expressed across different tissues. Twelve adolescents, age 15.0\u201317.9\u00a0years, with T1D duration of more than 8\u00a0years (mean 11.1\u00a0years), were enrolled from the Swedish diabetes quality registry. An age-matched control group was recruited. Circulating miRNAs (n = 187) were analyzed by quantitative PCR. We observed that 27 miRNAs were upregulated and one was downregulated in T1D. Six of these miRNAs were tissue-enriched (blood cells, gastrointestinal, nerve, and thyroid tissues). Six miRNAs with the largest difference in plasma, five up-regulated (hsa-miR-101-3p, hsa-miR-135a-5p, hsa-miR-143-3p, hsa-miR-223-3p and hsa-miR-410-3p (novel for T1D)) and one down-regulated (hsa-miR-495-3p), with P-values below 0.01, were selected for further in-silico analyses. AKT1, VEGFA and IGF-1 were identified as common targets. In conclusion, 28 of the investigated miRNAs were differently regulated in long-duration T1D in comparison with controls. Several associations with cancer were found for the six miRNAs with the largest difference in plasma.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165363984"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1038/s41598-023-38615-7"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
