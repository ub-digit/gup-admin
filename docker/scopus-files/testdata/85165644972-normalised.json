However, the detailed regional associations of these biomarkers with microglial activation in individual patients remain to be elucidated. We investigated a cohort of 55 patients with AD and primary tauopathies and 10 healthy controls that underwent TSPO-, A\u03b2-, tau-, and perfusion-surrogate-PET, as well as structural MRI. Z-score deviations for 246 brain regions were calculated and biomarker contributions of A\u03b2 (A), tau (T), perfusion (N1), and gray matter atrophy (N2) to microglial activation (TSPO, I) were calculated for each individual subject. Individual ATN-related microglial activation was correlated with clinical performance and CSF soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) concentrations. In typical and atypical AD, regional tau was stronger and more frequently associated with microglial activation when compared to regional A\u03b2 (AD: \u03b2T = 0.412 \u00b1 0.196 vs. \u03b2A = 0.142 \u00b1 0.123, p < 0.001; AD-CBS: \u03b2T = 0.385 \u00b1 0.176 vs. \u03b2A = 0.131 \u00b1 0.186, p = 0.031). The strong association between regional tau and microglia reproduced well in primary tauopathies (\u03b2T = 0.418 \u00b1 0.154). Stronger individual associations between tau and microglial activation were associated with poorer clinical performance. In patients with 4RT, sTREM2 levels showed a positive association with tau-related microglial activation. Tau pathology has strong regional associations with microglial activation in primary and secondary tauopathies. Tau and A\u03b2 related microglial response indices may serve as a two-dimensional in vivo assessment of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165644972"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1038/s41380-023-02188-8"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
