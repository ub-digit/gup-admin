However, knowledge regarding such responses is limited due to data scarcity. We studied the impact of growth temperature on net photosynthesis (An), maximum rates of Rubisco carboxylation at 25\u00a0\u00b0C (Vcmax25), stomatal conductance (gs) and the slope parameter of the stomatal conductance-photosynthesis model (g1), in 10 early successional (ES) and 8 late-successional (LS) tropical tree species grown at three sites along an elevation gradient in Rwanda, differing by 6.8\u00a0\u00b0C in daytime ambient air temperature. The effect of seasonal drought on An was also investigated. We found that warm climate decreased wet-season An in LS species, but not in ES species. Values of Vcmax25 were lower at the warmest site across both successional groups, and An and Vcmax25 were higher in ES compared with LS species. Stomatal conductance exhibited no significant site differences and g1 was similar across both sites and successional groups. Drought strongly reduced An at warmer sites but not at the coolest montane site and this response was similar in both ES and LS species. Our results suggest that warming has negative effects on leaf-level photosynthesis in LS species, while both LS and ES species suffer photosynthesis declines in a warmer climate with more pronounced droughts. The contrasting responses of An between successional groups may lead to shifts in species' competitive balance in a warmer world, to the disadvantage of LS trees.", "keywords": "drought, elevation gradient, physiological responses, tropical trees, warming", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164280908"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1093/treephys/tpad035"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
