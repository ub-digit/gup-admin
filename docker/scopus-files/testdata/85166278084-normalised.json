In the first section, this research reviews the adoption of BPM tools in the industry with some concrete examples and descriptions. The continuous development trend and the benefits of integrating BPM tools into the businesses are presented. The project will then review the academic literature on BPM that would cover BPM\u2019s definition, the development of BPM theories, and the associated tools. Three BPM tools, namely Bizagi BPM Suite, ProcessMaker and Flokzu, analyse specifically will be analysed in this paper, in detail with a real business process as an example. A method adjusted from Vuksic et al.\u2019s (2007) guidelines for selecting discrete event simulation (DES) tools will be used to evaluate and compare the BPM tools. This paper found that among the tools evaluated, Bizagi and Flokzu have a more intuitive user interface and process maker is the least user-friendly tool. Bizagi is recommended for large and middle-sized organisations and Flokzu for smaller organisations.", "keywords": "Bizagi, BPM Suites, comparison, descriptions, Flokzu, model, ProcessMaker", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166278084"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1504/IJBIS.2023.132065"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
