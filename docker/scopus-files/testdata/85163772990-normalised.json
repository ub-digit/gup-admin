It has been shown to be an essential virulence factor for the establishment of various bacterial infections, including septic arthritis. However, the development of potent Sortase A inhibitors remains an unmet challenge. Sortase A relies on a five amino acid sorting signal (LPXTG), by which it recognizes its natural target. We report the synthesis of a series of peptidomimetic inhibitors of Sortase A based on the sorting signal, supported by computational binding analysis. By employing a FRET-compatible substrate, our inhibitors were assayed in vitro. Among our panel, we identified several promising inhibitors with IC50 values below 200 \u03bcM, with our strongest inhibitor - LPRDSar - having an IC50 of 18.9 \u03bcM. Furthermore, it was discovered that three of our compounds show an effect on growth and biofilm inhibition of pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus, with the inclusion of a phenyl ring seemingly key to this effect. The most promising compound in our panel, BzLPRDSar, could inhibit biofilm formation at concentrations as low as 32 \u03bcg mL\u22121, manifesting it as a potential future drug lead. This could lead to treatments for MRSA infections in clinics and diseases such as septic arthritis, which has been directly linked with SrtA.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163772990"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1039/d3sc01209c"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
