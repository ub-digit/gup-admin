Cell membranes are primarily composed of phospholipids containing dietarily obtained fatty acids, which poses a challenge to membrane properties because diets can vary greatly in their fatty acid composition and could impart opposite properties to the cellular membranes. In particular, saturated fatty acids (SFAs) can pack tightly and form rigid membranes (like butter at room temperature) while unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) form more fluid membranes (like vegetable oils). Proteins of the PAQR protein family, characterized by the presence of seven transmembrane domains and a cytosolic N-terminus, contribute to membrane homeostasis in bacteria, yeasts, and animals. These proteins respond to membrane rigidity by stimulating fatty acid desaturation and incorporation of UFAs into phospholipids and explain the ability of animals to thrive on diets with widely varied fat composition.", "keywords": "adiponectin receptor, AdipoR, dietary fat, homeoviscous adaptation, membrane, PAQR, phospholipid", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163179248"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1002/bies.202300079"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
