The aim is to understand how gender mainstreaming was implemented, and with what effects. Little is still known about gender mainstreaming in crisis management and policymaking, and even less is known in relation to pandemic policy responses. To contribute to this field of knowledge, the article therefore analyses the Swedish National Recovery and Resilience Plan, supplemented by interviews with public servants, to understand the factors that impact the implementation of gender mainstreaming in policymaking in times of societal crises. At a theoretical level, the article draws on feminist institutionalism and implementation studies, the notion of resilience, and insights from critical frame analysis. The data is based on a larger dataset collected as part of the EU-funded RESISTIR\u00c9: Responding to Outbreaks through Co-creative Inclusive Equality Strategies project. The results indicate that gender mainstreaming is limited in its rationale and scope in times of crisis and that the integration of a gender equality perspective in crisis management needs to be developed in several important ways.", "keywords": "crisis, economy, gender equality, gender mainstreaming, National Recovery and Resilience Plan, pandemic policymaking, RESISTIR\u00c9, Sweden", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167341440"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.5565/rev/papers.3174"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60008141", "scopus-affilname": "\u00d6rebro Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Orebro", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Anne Charlott", "first_name": "Callerstig", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-2741-7263"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57207969522"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60008141", "scopus-affilname": "\u00d6rebro Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Orebro", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Sofia", "first_name": "Strid", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-7822-4563"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55148353200"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
