Although the population may be small in absolute terms, treatment needs may be greater than for those who began injecting as adults. Such knowledge may help tailor services more effectively. Previous research tends to use selective samples or focuses solely on medical indicators. The present study uses a larger sample drawn from national register data in Sweden over a 9-year period (2013\u20132021) to analyze differences in medical and social treatment needs between people who began injecting as legal minors and their older counterparts. Method: Data on first-time visitors to needle and syringe programmes (n = 8225, mean age 37.6, 26% women) were used. Historical socio-demographics and presenting treatment needs were compared between those with a debut injecting age under 18, and those who began injecting as adults. Results: The prevalence of injecting before 18 years was 29%. This group had more negative social circumstances, such as leaving school early, worse health, and greater service consumption, compared to those who began injecting as adults. In particular, they had been subjected to a greater level of control measures, such as arrest and compulsory care. Conclusions: The present study shows that there are important health and social differences between those who inject prior to 18 and those who begin injecting as adults. This raises important questions for both child protection services and harm reduction approaches for legal minors who inject, who still qualify as \u2018children\u2019 in a legal and policy sense.", "keywords": "adolescent, child protection, Child-centered harm reduction, harm reduction policy, injecting drug use, prevention, youth", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163041225"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/10826084.2023.2223267"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
