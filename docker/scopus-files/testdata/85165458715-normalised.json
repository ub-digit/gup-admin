We examine this form of lending as a critical mechanism of the dependent financialization of housing in the region and look at its political and class-based repercussions in the four most significant national cases: Croatia, Hungary, Poland and Serbia. This introduction reviews and connects the so far largely separate threads of research on CHF lending (on its political economy, partisan and movement politics, and debtors\u2019 experiences), summarizes the case studies, and draws out their key comparative insights. While lending waves originated in the same macrostructural relations and produced similar booms and crises, the management of the crises diverged significantly, depending on macroeconomic conditions, the projects of political elites, and debtors\u2019 class background and modes of contestation. The two main openings for contestation were litigation and political pressure, with varied limitations and results across national contexts. While delivering some important achievements, the politics of debtors\u2019 movements remained limited to a single-issue and legalistic contestation of specific predatory lending practices, which ultimately defended mortgaged homeownership from excessive financial predation. This reflects middle-class debtors\u2019 position in the multi-scalar hierarchies of dependent financialization, and the fact that litigation was the main state infrastructure available for their contestation. We argue that more progressive reactions to housing financialization would require movement infrastructures that are able to address the multiple scales of dependent financialization, and forms of cross-class local organization that are able to pursue agendas beyond available state infrastructures.", "keywords": "debtors\u2019 movements, dependent financialization, Eastern Europe, housing, Swiss franc mortgages", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165458715"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/13604813.2023.2229695"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
