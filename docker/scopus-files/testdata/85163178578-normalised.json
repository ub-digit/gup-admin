Multiple cameras are conventionally employed for measurement in such scenarios making the experimental setup not only cost-intensive but also challenging. To circumvent this, structured illumination (SI)-based methods are reported for multispecies chemiluminescence (CL) imaging using a single camera. In this paper, we demonstrate four-channel SI-based imaging for simultaneous snapshot CH\u2217 and C\u22172 CL imaging and two-color pyrometry for temperature profiles in a butane diffusion flame. We demonstrate our approach using individual species and multiple species imaging. Taking the advantage of the axisymmetric nature of the flame, the Abel transform is performed on the line-of-sight averaged images to obtain deconvoluted images. The deconvoluted maps of temperature are compared with the temperature data obtained by using a physical thermocouple probe.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163178578"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1364/AO.484213"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
