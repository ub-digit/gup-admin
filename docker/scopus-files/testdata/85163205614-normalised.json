We compared hazard ratios (HR) of revision of primary stemmed cementless THAs with metal-on-metal (MoM), ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC), and ceramic-on-highly-crosslinked-polyethylene (CoXLP) with that of metal-on-highly-crosslinked-polyethylene (MoXLP) bearings in patients aged 20\u201355 years with primary osteoar-thritis or childhood hip disorders. Patients and methods \u2014 From the Nordic Arthroplasty Register Association dataset we included 1,813 MoM, 3,615 CoC, 5,947 CoXLP, and 10,219 MoXLP THA in patients operated on between 2005 and 2017 in a prospective cohort study. We used the Kaplan\u2013Meier estimator for THA sur-vivorship and Cox regression to estimate HR of revision adjusted for confounders (including 95% confidence intervals [CI]). MoXLP was used as reference. HRs were calcu-lated during 3 intervals (0\u20132, 2\u20137, and 7\u201313 years) to meet the assumption of proportional hazards. Results \u2014 Median follow-up was 5 years for MoXLP, 10 years for MoM, 6 years for CoC, and 4 years for CoXLP. 13-year Kaplan\u2013Meier survival estimates were 95% (CI 94\u201395) for MoXLP, 82% (CI 80\u201384) for MoM, 93% (CI 92\u201395) for CoC, and 93% (CI 92\u201394) for CoXLP bearings. MoM had higher 2\u20137 and 7\u201313 years\u2019 adjusted HRs of revi-sion (3.6, CI 2.3\u20135.7 and 4.1, CI 1.7\u201310). MoXLP, CoC, and CoXLP had similar HRs in all 3 periods. The 7\u201313-year adjusted HRs of revision of CoC and CoXLP were statisti-cally non-significantly higher. Conclusion \u2014 In young patients, MoXLP for primary cementless THA had higher revision-free survival and lower HR for revision than MoM bearings. Longer follow-up is needed to compare MoXLP, CoC, and CoXLP.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163205614"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.2340/17453674.2023.13384"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
