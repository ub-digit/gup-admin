Because of a sudden transition to online learning and cancellation of in-person fieldwork opportunities, this group of fledgling researchers conducted a small research project that sought answers to the question\u2014What does it mean to live well in a world worth living in? The purpose of the project was to find out how this particular group of people, in a certain time and place, would respond to this question. Four themes emerged: political engagement; connection and basic needs; social stratification and access; living slow and in \u2018flow\u2019. This chapter outlines this project from the perspective of a research student and the teacher, and illumi-nates the various student groups\u2019 understandings of what it means to live well in a world worth living in. Using the theories of \u2018communities of practice\u2019 and \u2018practice architectures\u2019, the chapter reflects on the dynamics and processes through which the research student groups engaged with the subject; and what their experience might mean for educational researcher training.", "keywords": "Communities of practice, International masters education research, Research training, Theory of practice architectures", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163452779"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/978-981-19-7985-9_8"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
