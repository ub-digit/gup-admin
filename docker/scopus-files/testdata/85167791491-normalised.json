We investigated whether regular ICS exposure affects risk, severity, or survival in SARS-CoV-2 infection, using a nationwide linked Swedish population register database. Patients and Methods: During January\u2013December 2020, we studied two defined Swedish adult populations \u2013 Whole population [\u226540 years] (N = 5243479), and COPD subpopulation [\u226540 years] (N = 133372), in three study cohorts, respectively: 1. Overall cohort (index date 1 Jan 2020), 2. COVID-19 diagnosed sub-cohort (index date = diagnosis date), and 3. COVID-19 hospitalized sub-cohort (index date = admission date). Regular exposure was defined as \u22653 ICS prescriptions in the year before index. Hazard ratios (HRs) for outcomes (COVID-19 onset, hospitalization, ICU admission, or death) related to ICS exposure were estimated using Cox regression. Confounding was controlled by propensity score methods applying Average Treatment effect in the Treated (ATT) weighting. Results: Regular ICS use was associated with only very slightly increased onset of COVID-19, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death in the overall whole population cohort and in the overall COPD subpopulation cohort, except for ICU admission (marginally non-significant HRs, up to 1.13); and no clear increase in the diagnosed sub-cohorts. However, in the COVID-19 hospitalized COPD sub-cohort, ICS therapy showed reduced risks against progression to ICU admission and death, significant for death (HR 0.82 95% CI [0.67\u20130.99]). Conclusion: For COPD patients, ICS therapy offers some protection against progression to ICU admission and death among COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Our findings alleviate concerns about increased risks of COVID-19 by ICS treatment and provide evidence supporting the continuation of ICS therapy for COPD patients.", "keywords": "COPD, COVID \u221219, mortality", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167791491"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.2147/COPD.S404913"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60026559", "scopus-affilname": "Universitetssjukhuset i Link\u00f6ping", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Linkoping", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Marina", "first_name": "Labor", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "47461321000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Brian K.", "first_name": "Kirui", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57218423166"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Fredrik", "first_name": "Nyberg", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7103022770"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Lowie E.G.W.", "first_name": "Vanfleteren", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "26028693900"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
