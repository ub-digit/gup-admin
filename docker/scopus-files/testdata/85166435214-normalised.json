However, how p-cresol affects gut hormones is unclear. Here, we expose immortalized GLUTag cells to increasing concentrations of p-cresol and found that p-cresol inhibited Gcg expression and reduced glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion in vitro. In mice, administration of p-cresol in the drinking water for 2 weeks reduced the transcript levels of Gcg and other gut hormones in the colon; however, it did not affect either fasting or glucose-induced plasma GLP-1 levels. Furthermore, it did not affect glucose tolerance but promoted faster small intestinal transit in mice. Overall, our data suggest that microbial metabolite p-cresol suppresses transcript levels of gut hormones and regulates small intestinal transit in mice.", "keywords": "GLP-1, metabolic disease, microbial metabolite, p-cresol, small intestinal transit", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166435214"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3389/fendo.2023.1200391"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
