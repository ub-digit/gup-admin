Objective: To investigate if and how obesity, with or without diabetes, affects the survival of patients with OHCA. Methods: This study included 55,483 patients with OHCA reported to the Swedish Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation between 2010 and 2020. Patients were classified in five groups: obesity only (Ob), type 1 diabetes only (T1D), type 2 diabetes only (T2D), obesity and any diabetes (ObD), or belonging to the group other (OTH). Patient characteristics and outcomes were studied using descriptive statistics, logistic, and Cox proportional regression. Results: Obesity only was found in 2.7% of the study cohort, while 3.2% had obesity and any type of diabetes. Ob patients were significantly younger than all other patients (p \u2264 0.001); the 30 day-survival was 9.6% in Ob, and 10.6%, 7.3%, 6.9%, and 12.7% in T1D, T2D, ObD, and OTH, respectively, with OR (95% CI) of 0.69 (0.57\u20130.82), 0.78 (0.56\u20131.05), 0.65 (0.59\u20130.71), and 0.55 (0.45\u20130.66) for Ob, T1D, T2D, and ObD, respectively (reference group OTH). No time-related trends in 30-days survival were found. Conclusion: Obesity was present in 6% of the population and was associated with younger age and a 30% reduction in survival; a combination of obesity and diabetes further reduced the survival rate.", "keywords": "Diabetes, Obesity, Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, Survival", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167466067"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.resplu.2023.100446"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
