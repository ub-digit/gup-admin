The objective of this sub-analysis of the European multicenter observational cohort study Candida III was to describe demographical and clinical characteristics of the cohort requiring prolonged hospitalization solely to complete intravenous (iv) antifungal treatment (AF Tx). Methods: Each participating hospital (number of eligible hospitals per country determined by population size) included the first ~ 10 blood culture proven adult candidemia cases occurring consecutively after July 1st, 2018, and treating physicians answered the question on whether hospital stay was prolonged only for completion of intravenous antifungal therapy. Descriptive analyses as well as binary logistic regression was used to assess for predictors of prolonged hospitalization solely to complete iv AF Tx. Findings: Hospital stay was prolonged solely for the completion of iv AF Tx in 16% (100/621) of candidemia cases by a median of 16\u00a0days (IQR 8 \u2013 28). In the multivariable model, initial echinocandin treatment was a positive predictor for prolonged hospitalization to complete iv AF Tx (aOR 2.87, 95% CI 1.55 \u2013 5.32, p < 0.001), while (i) neutropenia, (ii) intensive care unit admission, (iii) catheter related candidemia, (iv) total parenteral nutrition, and (v) C.\u00a0parapsilosis as causative pathogen were found to be negative predictors (aOR 0.22 \u2013 0.45; p < 0.03). Interpretation: Hospital stays were prolonged due to need of iv AF Tx in 16% of patients with candidemia. Those patients were more likely to receive echinocandins as initial treatment and\u00a0were less severely ill\u00a0and less likely infected with C. parapsilosis.", "keywords": "Candida albicans, Candida auris, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Guidelines, Mortality", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167834408"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s11046-023-00776-4"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
