The analysis focuses on Gothenburg's efforts to reduce inequality and segregation, with urban planning as one of the instruments used in this endeavor. By examining the chain of events from policy objectives to implementation, I demonstrate the systematic deprioritization of equality and identify the mechanisms that contribute to this phenomenon. Through the analysis of key documents and interviews with politicians and officials, multiple interconnected processes are identified, collectively generating a governance form referred to as inequality realism.", "keywords": "m\u00e5lkonflikter, Oj\u00e4mlikhet, organisatoriskt tryck, styrning, transporterande id\u00e9er", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165198564"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.37062/sf.60.25000"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
