It is based on 17 in-depth interviews with foodie micro-influencers based in London and Barcelona. Interview data was complemented with participant observation in restaurants or cafes. This paper makes three original contributions. Firstly, the study expands the understanding of the concept of \u2018instagrammability\u2019 by approaching it from the perspective of influencers creating content to satisfy and/or grow an audience. Secondly, it illustrates how two dominant factors drive influencers\u2019 content creation process: the self/audience focus content branding orientation. The \u2018audience-focus\u2019 content development process varied drastically, with some influencers being very conscious of responding to their audiences\u2019 needs whereas others maintained first and foremost a very strong \u2018self-focus\u2019. However, even for the influencers who were the most responsive to their audiences\u2019 perceived wishes, a sense of \u2018self-focus\u2019 was maintained as an anchor point in all developed content, often linked to a passion for a certain type of food. Thirdly, this paper maps and describes the behind-the-scenes content creation process adopted by micro-influencers, including four stages (1) Content Planning, (2) Media Gathering, (3) Editing, and (4) Publishing, which was followed by an engagement phase. This study offers a timely contribution to better comprehend the content creation cycle adopted by micro-influencers by using foodie influencers as a case study.", "keywords": "Content creation, food, foodie, influencer, Instagram, self-branding", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168127157"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/1369118X.2023.2246524"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
