Depending on how the involved weight function is specified, these summary statistics capture different kinds of local dependence structures. We first derive some basic properties and show how these new statistical tools can be used to construct most existing summary statistics for (marked) point processes. We then propose a local test of random labeling. This procedure allows us to identify points, and consequently regions, where the random labeling assumption does not hold, for example, when the (functional) marks are spatially dependent. Through a simulation study we show that the test is able to detect local deviations from random labeling. We also provide an application to an earthquake point pattern with functional marks given by seismic waveforms.", "keywords": "Earthquakes, Functional marked point process, Local envelope test, Mark correlation function, Marked K-function, Random labeling", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162682218"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/10618600.2023.2206441"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
