Methods: A noninterventional database review was conducted in Sweden among adults with T1D using multiple daily injection (MDI) regimens who had switched to treatment with faster aspart as part of basal-bolus treatment. Glycemic data were retrospectively collected during the 26\u00a0weeks before switching (baseline) and up to 32\u00a0weeks after switching (follow-up) to assess changes in time in glycemic range (TIR; 70\u2013180\u00a0mg/dL), mean sensor glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, coefficient of variation, time in hyperglycemia (level\u00a01, > 180 to \u2264 250\u00a0mg/dL; level\u00a02, > 250\u00a0mg/dL), and time in hypoglycemia (level\u00a01, \u2265 54 to < 70\u00a0mg/dL; level\u00a02, < 54\u00a0mg/dL) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03895515). Results: Overall, 178 participants were included in the study cohort. The analysis population included 82 individuals (mean age 48.5\u00a0years) with adequate glucose sensor data. From baseline to follow-up, statistically significant improvements were reported for TIR (mean increase 3.3%-points [approximately 48\u00a0min/day]; p = 0.006) with clinically relevant improvement (\u2265 5%) in 43% of participants. Statistically significant improvements from baseline were observed for mean sensor glucose levels, HbA1c levels, and time in hyperglycemia (levels\u00a01 and 2), with no statistically significant changes in time spent in hypoglycemia. Conclusions: Switching to faster aspart was associated with improvements in glycemic control without increasing hypoglycemia in adults with T1D using MDI in this real-world setting.", "keywords": "Diabetes mellitus, type\u00a01, Glycemic control, Insulin, short-acting, Time in range", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164777412"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s13300-023-01444-y"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
