Swedish school companies have been active in exporting schooling in the international arena, including \u201cSwedish\u201d education models. In this article, we examine one company and their operations in India. We explore the interpretations of the company education model by teachers in the Indian schools, and how this affects their professional capacity. Mixed qualitative methods of interviews, on-site school visits and documentary reviews, were used to examine the possibilities for teachers to exercise professional agency within their working environment. Our findings show that teachers operate within a highly structured pedagogical environment characterised by a given curriculum, a centralised learning platform and training programme, and a set of dominant discourses around values and teaching practices. Teachers are expected to embrace a new professional identity in a process of discarding past experiences and adopting the new professional language given by the company's particular education model. In willingly embracing the company discourses and expectations, teachers\u2019 agency tends to be constrained.", "keywords": "India, international schools, local teachers, private education, Sweden, Teacher agency", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164717032"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/00131911.2023.2228507"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
