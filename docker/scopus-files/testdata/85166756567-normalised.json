Spasticity may severely impair arm and hand function, and consequently, affect an individual's function, resulting in disabilities or limiting activities and participation. Today, there is conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of available spasticity treatments. The population of adults with spasticity problems due to a CNS injury is heterogenic. A multidisciplinary approach is essential in customizing treatment to individual needs. The planning of treatment should consider the remaining upper limb functions and the patient's potential to improveme. Spasticity-correcting surgery is an option that seems underutilized. This article describes a structured and standardized program for the preoperative assessment, the surgical technique and the postoperative rehabilitation of patients undergoing upper limb spasticity-correcting surgery.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166756567"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
