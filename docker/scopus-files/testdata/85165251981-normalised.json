In this paper we continue the study of spectrally reasonable measures (measures perturbing any measure with a natural spectrum to a measure with a natural spectrum) initiated in [P. Ohrysko and M. Wojciechowski, St. Petersburg Math. J. 28 (2017)]. In particular, we provide a full characterization of such measures for a certain class of locally compact Abelian groups which includes the circle and the real line. We also elaborate on the spectral properties of measures with non-natural but real spectra, constructed by F. Parreau.", "keywords": "natural spectrum, spectrally reasonable measures, Wiener\u2013Pitt phenomenon", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165251981"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.4064/sm220704-22-11"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
