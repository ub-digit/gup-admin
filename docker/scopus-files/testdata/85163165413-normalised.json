However, it is challenging to tune a thin layer of structural color across the full red\u2013green\u2013blue (RGB) basis set of colors at video rates and with long-term stability. In this work, this is achieved through a hybrid cavity built from metal\u2013insulator\u2013metal (MIM) \u201cnanocaves\u201d and an electrochromic polymer (PProDOTMe2). The reflective colors are modulated by electrochemically doping/dedoping the polymer. Compared with traditional subpixel-based systems, this hybrid structure provides high reflectivity (>40%) due to its \u201cmonopixel\u201d nature and switches at video rates. The polymer bistability helps deliver ultralow power consumption (\u22482.5\u00a0mW\u00a0cm\u22122) for video display applications and negligible consumption (\u22483\u00a0\u00b5W\u00a0cm\u22122) for static images, compatible with fully photovoltaic powering. In addition, the color uniformity of the hybrid material is excellent (over cm\u22122) and the scalable fabrication enables large-area production.", "keywords": "electronic paper, high-reflectivity, hybrid nanocavities, video speed", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163165413"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1002/adma.202302028"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
