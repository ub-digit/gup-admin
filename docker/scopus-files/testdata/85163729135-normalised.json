The interplay of the host immune system with the invading pathogens impacts the pathophysiology of septic arthritis. Early antibiotic treatment is crucial for a better prognosis to save the patients from severe bone damage and later joint dysfunction. To date, there are no specific predictive biomarkers for septic arthritis. Transcriptome sequencing analysis identified S100a8/a9 genes to be highly expressed in septic arthritis compared to non-septic arthritis at the early course of infection in an Staphylococcus aureus septic arthritis mouse model. Importantly, downregulation of S100a8/a9 mRNA expression at the early course of infection was noticed in mice infected with the S. aureus Sortase A/B mutant strain totally lacking arthritogenic capacity compared with the mice infected with parental S. aureus arthritogenic strain. The mice infected intra-articularly with the S. aureus arthritogenic strain significantly increased S100a8/a9 protein expression levels in joints over time. Intriguingly, the synthetic bacterial lipopeptide Pam2CSK4 was more potent than Pam3CSK4 in inducing S100a8/a9 release upon intra-articular injection of these lipopeptides into the mouse knee joints. Such an effect was dependent on the presence of monocytes/macrophages. In conclusion, S100a8/a9 gene expression may serve as a potential biomarker to predict septic arthritis, enabling the development of more effective treatment strategies.", "keywords": "biomarker, mice, RNA sequencing, S100a8/a9, septic arthritis, Staphylococcus aureus", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163729135"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3389/fmicb.2023.1146694"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
