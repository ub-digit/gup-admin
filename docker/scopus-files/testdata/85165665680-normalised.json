Many benign simulators of LM and LMM, known as atypical pigmented facial lesions (aPFLs\u2014pigmented actinic keratosis, solar lentigo, seborrheic keratosis, seborrheic-lichenoid keratosis, atypical nevus) may be found on photodamaged skin. This generates many diagnostic issues and increases the number of biopsies, with a subsequent impact on aesthetic outcome and health insurance costs. Objectives: Our aim was to develop a risk-scoring classifier-based algorithm to estimate the probability of an aPFL being malignant. A second aim was to compare its diagnostic accuracy with that of dermoscopists so as to define the advantages of using the model in patient management. Materials and Methods: A total of 154 dermatologists analysed 1111 aPFLs and their management in a teledermatology setting: They performed pattern analysis, gave an intuitive clinical diagnosis and proposed lesion management options (follow-up/reflectance confocal microscopy/biopsy). Each case was composed of a dermoscopic and/or clinical picture plus metadata (histology, age, sex, location, diameter). The risk-scoring classifier was developed and tested on this dataset and then validated on 86 additional aPFLs. Results: The facial Integrated Dermoscopic Score (iDScore) model consisted of seven dermoscopic variables and three objective parameters (diameter \u2265 8 mm, age \u2265 70 years, male sex); the score ranged from 0 to 16. In the testing set, the facial iDScore-aided diagnosis was more accurate (AUC = 0.79 [IC 95% 0.757\u20130.843]) than the intuitive diagnosis proposed by dermatologists (average of 43.5%). In the management study, the score model reduced the number of benign lesions sent for biopsies by 41.5% and increased the number of LM/LMM cases sent for reflectance confocal microscopy or biopsy instead of follow-up by 66%. Conclusions: The facial iDScore can be proposed as a feasible tool for managing patients with aPFLs.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165665680"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/jdv.19360"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
