Early techniques used transtibial femoral tunnel drilling, although improved understanding of the anatomy and biomechanics has led to independent femoral tunnel. Anatomic ACLR requires careful consideration of the native ACL dimensions and orientation. Although there is significant variation between patients, understanding of anatomic patterns allows for reliable identification of the ACL footprints and appropriate tunnel positioning, particularly in chronic injuries where the remanent ACL stump is degraded or absent. The femoral tunnel should be placed low and posterior on the lateral femoral condyle using the lateral intercondylar and bifurcate ridges as landmarks. The center of the tibial footprint can be determined by referencing the medial tibial spine and posterior border of anterior horn of lateral meniscus. Measurement of the dimensions of the native ACL and intercondylar notch is also critical for determining graft size and minimizing the risk of impingement, with a goal of reconstructing 50% to 80% of the tibial footprint area. Clinical outcome studies have demonstrated superior anteroposterior and rotatory knee stability with low surgical revision rates (reported between 3% and 5%). By adhering to the principles of anatomic ACLR, surgeons can produce an appropriately sized and located graft for the individual patient, thereby best restoring native knee kinematics and maximizing function. The aim of this infographic is to highlight essential features of anatomic ACLR techniques, which a focus on the native anatomy and surgical planning to achieve an anatomic ACLR.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166519907"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.arthro.2023.03.004"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
