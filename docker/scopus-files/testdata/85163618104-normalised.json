Although 177Lu-DOTATATE is mostly well tolerated in patients, bone marrow suppression and long-term renal toxicity are still side effects that should be considered. Amino acids are often used to minimize renal radiotoxicity, however, they are associated with nausea and vomiting in patients. \u03b11-microglobulin (A1M) is an antioxidant with heme- and radical-scavenging abilities. A recombinant form (rA1M) has previously been shown to be renoprotective in preclinical models, including in PRRT-induced kidney damage. Here, we further investigated rA1M\u2019s renal protective effect in a mouse 177Lu-DOTATATE model in terms of administration route and dosing regimen and as a combined therapy with amino acids (Vamin). Moreover, we investigated the protective effect of rA1M on peripheral blood and bone marrow cells, as well as circulatory biomarkers. Intravenous (i.v.) administration of rA1M reduced albuminuria levels and circulatory levels of the oxidative stress-related protein fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21). Dual injections of rA1M (i.e., at 0 and 24 h post-177Lu-DOTATATE administration) preserved bone marrow cellularity and peripheral blood reticulocytes. Administration of Vamin, alone or in combination with rA1M, did not show any protection of bone marrow cellularity or peripheral reticulocytes. In conclusion, this study suggests that rA1M, administered i.v. for two consecutive days in conjunction with 177Lu-DOTATATE, may reduce hematopoietic and kidney toxicity during PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE.", "keywords": "amino acids, bone marrow toxicity, oxidative stress, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, radiation, renal damage, \u03b1 -microglobulin 1", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163618104"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/biom13060928"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
