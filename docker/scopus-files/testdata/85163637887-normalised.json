We improve visual story generation by producing a new image-grounded dataset, Visual Writing Prompts (VWP). VWP contains almost 2K selected sequences of movie shots, each including 5-10 images. The image sequences are aligned with a total of 12K stories which were collected via crowd-sourcing given the image sequences and a set of grounded characters from the corresponding image sequence. Our new image sequence col-lection and filtering process has allowed us to obtain stories that are more coherent, diverse, and visually grounded compared to previous work. We also propose a character-based story generation model driven by coherence as a strong baseline. Evaluations show that our generated stories are more coherent, visually grounded, and diverse than stories generated with the current state-of-the-art model. Our code, image features, annotations and collected stories are available at https://vwprompt.github.io/.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163637887"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1162/tacl_a_00553"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
