This region promotes a challenging environment for the successfulness of dental components due to the transitional characteristics between soft and hard tissues, the presence of bacteria, and mechanical forces. This review explored the most current approaches to modify trans-mucosal components in terms of macro-design and surface properties. Methods: This critical review article revised intensely the literature until July 2023 to demonstrate, discuss, and summarize the current knowledge about marketable and innovative trans-mucosal components for dental implants. Results: A large number of dental implant brands have promoted the development of several implant-abutment designs in the clinical market. The progress of abutment designs shows an optimistic reduction of bacteria colonization underlying the implant-abutment gap, although, not completely inhibited. Fundamental and preclinical studies have demonstrated promising outcomes for altered-surface properties targeting antibacterial properties and soft tissue sealing. Nanotopographies, biomimetic coatings, and antibiotic-release properties have been shown to be able to modulate, align, orient soft tissue cells, and induce a reduction in biofilm formation, suggesting superior abilities compared to the current trans-mucosal platforms available on the market. Significance: Future clinical implant-abutments show the possibility to reduce peri-implant diseases and fortify soft tissue interaction with the implant-substrate, defending the implant system from bacteria invasion. However, the absence of technologies translated to commercial stages reveals the need for findings to \u201cbridge the gap\u201d between scientific evidences published and applied science in the industry.", "keywords": "Abutments, Antibacterial properties, Nanotechnology, Oral rehabilitation, Periimplantitis, Surface technology", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168757439"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.dental.2023.07.009"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60015760", "scopus-affilname": "Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio Grande do Sul", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Porto Alegre", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Brazil"}, {"scopus-afid": "60015760", "scopus-affilname": "Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio Grande do Sul", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Porto Alegre", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Brazil"}, {"scopus-afid": "60004831", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Marcel F.", "first_name": "Kunrath", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57202582818"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60015760", "scopus-affilname": "Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio Grande do Sul", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Porto Alegre", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Brazil"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Maur\u00edcio do N.", "first_name": "Gerhardt", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57211654452"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
