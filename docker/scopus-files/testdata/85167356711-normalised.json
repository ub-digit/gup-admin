It argues that individuals\u2019 personality traits may condition the effect of corruption experience on trust and that these traits also affect how individuals are exposed to corrupt experiences. Using data from the AmericasBarometer 2010, the study finds that openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness and emotional stability amplify the negative effect of corruption on trust in the police. However, only extraversion amplifies the negative effect of corrupt experiences on trust in government. The study also finds that openness, extraversion, agreeableness and emotional stability are linked to exposure to corruption. The study contributes to the literature by showing that personality affects exposure to corruption and constrains the effect of corruption on political trust.", "keywords": "big five, bribery, Corruption exposure, institutional trust, police", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167356711"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/01925121231186556"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
