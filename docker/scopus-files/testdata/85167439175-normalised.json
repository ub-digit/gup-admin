There is a dearth of research investigating such associations and the available findings are inconsistent. Conclusions about the relations between experiences such as stimulation and support in the home in early childhood or best friendship quality in adolescence and adult personality should thus be viewed skeptically until replicated.", "keywords": "adult personality, childhood experiences, friendship in adolescence, home environment, longitudinal study", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167439175"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.5114/cipp/156764"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Maria", "first_name": "W\u00e4ngqvist", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55931524100"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60012614", "scopus-affilname": "Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Zurich", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Switzerland"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Mathias", "first_name": "Allemand", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "15062382800"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Ann", "first_name": "Fris\u00e9n", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "12646889400"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031101", "scopus-affilname": "University of Cambridge", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Cambridge", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United Kingdom"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Michael E.", "first_name": "Lamb", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7102285207"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "C.
