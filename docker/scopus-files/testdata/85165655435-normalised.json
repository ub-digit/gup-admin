Students may be able to provide a correct solution using only calculus without drawing free-body diagrams. This can make their misconceptions go unnoticed and put them at risk to become further reinforced. Here, we discuss first-year bachelor students\u2019 responses to multiple-choice questions and an open-ended question regarding friction when they come fresh out of high school. We further look into student solutions submitted to a national competition in physics for high-school students involving a problem concerning the acceleration of an electric rear-wheel drive car. Finding that most students had avoided drawing figures, we discuss to what extent teachers\u2019 grading practices contribute to students\u2019 development of problem-solving habits.", "keywords": "acceleration, free-body diagram, friction, grading, graphs, power, pseudowork", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165655435"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1088/1361-6552/ace1c7"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60000990", "scopus-affilname": "Chalmers University of Technology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Andreas", "first_name": "Isacsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-6908-5696"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7003930863"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "129990274", "scopus-affilname": "N\u00f6sn\u00e4sgymnasiet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stenungsund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Niklas", "first_name": "Malmgren", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58504639800"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60029170", "scopus-affilname": "Lunds Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Ann Marie", "first_name": "Pendrill", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-1405-6561"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6603210420"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
