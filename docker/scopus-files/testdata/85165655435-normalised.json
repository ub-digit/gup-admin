Students may be able to provide a correct solution using only calculus without drawing free-body diagrams. This can make their misconceptions go unnoticed and put them at risk to become further reinforced. Here, we discuss first-year bachelor students\u2019 responses to multiple-choice questions and an open-ended question regarding friction when they come fresh out of high school. We further look into student solutions submitted to a national competition in physics for high-school students involving a problem concerning the acceleration of an electric rear-wheel drive car. Finding that most students had avoided drawing figures, we discuss to what extent teachers\u2019 grading practices contribute to students\u2019 development of problem-solving habits.", "keywords": "acceleration, free-body diagram, friction, grading, graphs, power, pseudowork", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165655435"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1088/1361-6552/ace1c7"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
