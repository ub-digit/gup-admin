METHODS: We estimated the sample size needed to test a 25% drug effect with 80% of power at a 0.05 level on reducing changes in plasma markers in CU participants from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. RESULTS: We included 257 CU individuals (45.5% males; mean age = 73 [6] years; 32% \u03b2-amyloid [A\u03b2] positive). Changes in plasma NfL were associated with age, whereas changes in plasma p-tau181 with progression to amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Clinical trials using p-tau181 and NfL would require 85% and 63% smaller sample sizes, respectively, for a 24-month than a 12-month follow-up. A population enrichment strategy using intermediate levels of A\u03b2 PET (Centiloid 20-40) further reduced the sample size of the 24-month clinical trial using p-tau181 (73%) and NfL (59%) as a surrogate. DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau181/NfL can potentially be used to monitor large-scale population interventions in CU individuals. The enrollment of CU with intermediate A\u03b2 levels constitutes the alternative with the largest effect size and most cost-effective for trials testing drug effect on changes in plasma p-tau181 and NfL.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164208991"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1212/WNL.0000000000207115"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
