PGLs can further be divided into sympathetic (sPGLs) and head-and-neck (HN-PGLs). There are virtually no treatment options, and no cure, for metastatic PCCs and PGLs (PPGLs). Here, we composed a tissue microarray (TMA) consisting of 149 PPGLs, reflecting clinical features, presenting as a useful resource. Mutations in the pseudohypoxic marker HIF-2\u03b1 correlate to an aggressive tumor phenotype. We show that HIF-2\u03b1 localized to the cytoplasm in PPGLs. This subcompartmentalized protein expression differed between tumor subtypes, and strongly correlated to proliferation. Half of all sPGLs were metastatic at time of diagnosis. Cytoplasmic HIF-2\u03b1 was strongly expressed in metastatic sPGLs and predicted poor outcome in this subgroup. We propose that higher cytoplasmic HIF-2\u03b1 expression could serve as a useful clinical marker to differentiate paragangliomas from pheochromocytomas, and may help predict outcome in sPGL patients.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165240059"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1038/s41598-023-38606-8"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
