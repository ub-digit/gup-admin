Here we demonstrate that NMR contrast based on the transport of DNP-enhanced polarization can be exploited in the challenging case of early detection of a small amount of a minor polymorphic phase within a major polymorph, and we show that this approach can yield quantitative information on the spatial distribution of the two polymorphs. We focus on the detection of a minor amount (<4%) of polymorph III of m-aminobenzoic acid within a powder sample of polymorph I at natural isotopic abundance. Based on proposed models of the spatial distribution of the two polymorphs, simulations of 1H spin diffusion allow NMR data to be calculated for each model as a function of particle size and the relative amounts of the polymorphs. A comparison between simulated and experimental NMR data allows the model(s) best representing the spatial distribution of the polymorphs in the system to be established.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165146106"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1039/d3sc02063k"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
