To capture the experiences of the persons directly involved as well as their family members. Material and methods: Eight boys with DMD (aged 8\u201321; median age 17.7) and five of their parents were interviewed immediately post-intervention. Additionally, follow-up interviews were later performed with five boys and three parents. Results: Ten categories of intervention experiences emerged and were allocated to three aspects: \u201cPrerequisites in the treatment situation\u201d, \u201cThe intervention makes a difference\u201d and \u201cInstilling hope for the future\u201d. The requirements for intervention success include co-operation with parents and hand orthoses with a good fit. Maintained or increased joint mobility, reduced pain and improved occupational performance were experienced. Conclusion: The boys and parents perceived that the intervention with hand orthoses could counteract the deterioration of the boys\u2019 hands. This instilled hope of preserving occupational performance throughout life. They also considered that a good hand-orthosis fit, appropriate adjustments to daily routines and good co-operation with the people around them were important for the intervention to be and remain successful.", "keywords": "activity, hand function, Hand splints, neuromuscular disorders, occupational therapy", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168905988"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/09638288.2023.2251393"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60008841", "scopus-affilname": "Drottning Silvias Barnsjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Britt Marie", "first_name": "Eriksson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55951433600"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Marie", "first_name": "Peny-Dahlstrand", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-6026-1136"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "34768869200"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Birgitha", "first_name": "Archenholtz", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6603129083"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60008841", "scopus-affilname": "Drottning Silvias Barnsjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Johanna", "first_name": "Weichbrodt", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57194761935"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Git", "first_name": "Lidman", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56711222300"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
