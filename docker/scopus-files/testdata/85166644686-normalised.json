Globally, the levels of PA among individuals are below WHO recommendations. A lack of PA can increase morbidity and mortality, worsen the quality of life and increase the economic burden on individuals and society. In response to this trend, numerous organisations came together under one umbrella in Hamburg, Germany, in April 2021 and signed the \u00e2 \u20ac Hamburg Declaration'. This represented an international commitment to take all necessary actions to increase PA and improve the health of individuals to entire communities. Individuals and organisations are working together as the \u00e2 \u20ac Global Alliance for the Promotion of Physical Activity' to drive long-term individual and population-wide behaviour change by collaborating with all stakeholders in the community: active hospitals, physical activity specialists, community services and healthcare providers, all achieving sustainable health goals for their patients/clients. The \u00e2 \u20ac Hamburg Declaration' calls on national and international policymakers to take concrete action to promote daily PA and exercise at a population level and in healthcare settings.", "keywords": "Health promotion, Physical activity, Physical activity promotion in primary care, Sports &amp; exercise medicine, Sports medicine", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166644686"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1136/bmjsem-2023-001626"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
