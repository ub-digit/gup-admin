Methods: Data were collected in Swedish pharmacies using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with patients. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was used, and the outcomes were usage rate, factors impacting on use, and perceived ease of use, usefulness, and benefits of self-reported question-asking and self-perceived medication knowledge. Descriptive statistics and group comparisons were performed, and qualitative data were analyzed thematically with the TAM. Results: Out of 145 patients filling out the questionnaire, 72 (50.0%) reported they had used the QPL. Patients with new prescriptions and non-native Swedish speakers used the QPL more often (p = 0.03; p = 0.009, respectively). The QPL was quick to read (86.3%) and easy to understand (91.4%). Forty percent stated that they asked more questions, and self-reported users scored higher on self-perceived medication knowledge. In the interviews (n = 14), the QPL was described as an eye-opener as to what one could ask the pharmacist. Conclusions: Patients were willing to use a QPL in community pharmacies. Practice implications: A QPL in pharmacies might improve patients' engagement medication knowledge, as well as showcase the expertise of pharmacists.", "keywords": "Communication, Community pharmacy, Empowerment, Patient activation, Question prompt list", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164221853"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.pec.2023.107862"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
