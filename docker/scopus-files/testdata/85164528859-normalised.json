To combat this problem, many Swedish municipalities have distributed ice cleats to older adults. While previous research has shown promising results, there is a lack of comprehensive empirical data on the effectiveness of ice cleat distribution. We address this gap by investigating the impact of these distribution programmes on ice-related fall injuries among older adults. Methods: We combined survey data on ice cleat distribution in Swedish municipalities with injury data from the Swedish National Patient Register (NPR). The survey was used to identify municipalities that have distributed ice cleats to older adults at some point between 2001 and 2019. Data from NPR were used to identify municipality-level data on patients who have been treated for injuries related to snow and ice. We used a triple differences design - a generalisation of difference in differences - that compared ice-related fall injury rates before and after intervention in 73 treatment and 200 control municipalities, with unexposed age groups serving as within-municipality controls. Results: We estimate that the average ice cleat distribution programmes reduced ice-related fall injury rates by -0.24 (95% CI -0.49 to 0.02) per 1000 person-winters. The impact estimate was larger in municipalities that distributed more ice cleats (-0.38 (95% CI -0.76 to -0.09)). No similar patterns were found for fall injuries unrelated to snow and ice. Conclusion: Our results suggest that ice cleat distribution can decrease the incidence of ice-related injuries among older adults.", "keywords": "Community, Equipment, Fall, Older People", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164528859"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1136/ip-2022-044808"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
