It has been used interchangeably with and is undifferentiated from concepts such as health and well-being without an in-depth clarification of its theoretical foundations and a reflection on its meaning. The concept of wellness is frequently used, but its definition remains unclear. Aim: To conceptually and theoretically explore the concept of wellness to contribute to a deeper understanding in caring science. Method: Rodgers' evolutionary concept analysis was applied to the theoretical investigation of data from publications of international origins. The focus was on antecedents, attributes, consequences, surrogate and related terms, and contextual references. A literature search was performed through a manual review of reference lists and an online search in CINAHL and PubMed via EBSCO, and in ProQuest. Abstracts were examined to identify relevant studies for further review. The inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed papers in English; papers published in scientific journals using the surrogate terms \u2018wellness\u2019, \u2018health\u2019, \u2018health care\u2019, and \u2018health care and wellness\u2019; and papers discussing and/or defining the concept of wellness. Twenty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Results: Based on the findings from this concept analysis, a definition of wellness was developed: \u2018a holistic and multidimensional concept represented on a continuum of being well that goes beyond health\u2019. Implications for nursing practice were correspondingly presented. Conclusion: Wellness is defined as a holistic and comprehensive multidimensional concept represented on a continuum of being well, that goes beyond health. It calls attention by applying the salutogenic perspective to health promotion in caring science. It is strongly related to individual lifestyle and health behaviour and is frequently used interchangeably with health and well-being without an in-depth clarification of its theoretical foundation.", "keywords": "caring science, health, health care, literature review, Rodgers' concept analysis, well-being, wellness", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166424951"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/scs.13196"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
