We discuss the differences in conceptualizations in relation to diverging understandings of climate change and the Anthropocene, focusing on perspectives on agentivity both within our respective ethnographical fields and in modernist social sciences. This leads us to stress the significance of new materialists\u2019 disregard for intentionality in relation to agency and the consequences this neglect has for understanding animist perspectives. We examine the different views in relation to their effects on morality and to perceived forms of accountability. In accordance, the modernist \u2018global we\u2019, prominent in the Anthropocene debate stressing the role of humanity as a species, is contrasted with what we call a \u2018universal we\u2019, which includes both human and other-than-human persons, in conformance with Amerindian animist perspectives on the world. This approach to the issue does not only mean that we challenge the obvious iniquity in blaming all of humanity for climate change but also that we point to the coloniality of reality implicit in the Anthropocene narrative.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167709839"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/1467-9655.14006"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Dan", "first_name": "Rosengren", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "15048655500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Stefan", "first_name": "Permanto", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57216697102"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Anders", "first_name": "Burman", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "37060298500"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
