One such process is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the neutrophil enzyme complex NADPH-oxidase, which can be assembled and active either extracellularly or intracellularly in phagosomes (during phagocytosis) and/or granules (in the absence of phagocytosis). One soluble factor modulating the interplay between immune cells and microbes is galectin-3 (gal-3), a carbohydrate-binding protein that regulates a wide variety of neutrophil functions. Gal-3 has been shown to potentiate neutrophil interaction with bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, and is also a potent activator of the neutrophil respiratory burst, inducing large amounts of granule-localized ROS in primed cells. Herein, the role of gal-3 in regulating S. aureus phagocytosis and S. aureus-induced intracellular ROS was analyzed by imaging flow cytometry and luminol-based chemiluminescence, respectively. Although gal-3 did not interfere with S. aureus phagocytosis per se, it potently inhibited phagocytosis-induced intracellular ROS production. Using the gal-3 inhibitor GB0139 (TD139) and carbohydrate recognition domain of gal-3 (gal-3C), we found that the gal-3-induced inhibitory effect on ROS production was dependent on the carbohydrate recognition domain of the lectin. In summary, this is the first report of an inhibitory role of gal-3 in regulating phagocytosis-induced ROS production.", "keywords": "Staphylococcus aureus, galectin-3, neutrophils, phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164042203"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1093/glycob/cwad032"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
