The international ISupport collaboration aimed to develop standards to outline and explain good procedural practice and the rights of children within the context of a clinical procedure. The rights-based standards for children undergoing tests, treatments, investigations, examinations and interventions were developed using an iterative, multi-phased, multi-method and multi-stakeholder consensus building approach. This consensus approach used a range of online and face to face methods across three phases to ensure ongoing engagement with multiple stakeholders. The views and perspectives of 203 children and young people, 78 parents and 418 multi-disciplinary professionals gathered over a two year period (2020\u20132022) informed the development of international rights-based standards for the care of children having tests, treatments, examinations and interventions. The standards are the first to reach international multi-stakeholder consensus on definitions of supportive and restraining holds. Conclusion: This is the first study of its kind which outlines international rights-based procedural care standards from multi-stakeholder perspectives. The standards offer health professionals and educators clear evidence-based tools to support discussions and practice changes to challenge prevailing assumptions about holding or restraining children and instead encourage a focus on the interests and rights of the child. What is Known: \u2022 Children continue to experience short and long-term\u00a0harm when undergoing clinical procedures despite increased evidence of the need to improve the provision of child-centred care. \u2022 Professionals report uncertainty and tensions in applying evidence-based practice to children\u2019s procedural care. What is New: \u2022 This is the first study of its kind which has developed international rights-based procedural care standards from multi-stakeholder perspectives. \u2022 The standards are the first to reach international multi-stakeholder consensus on definitions of supportive and restraining holds.", "keywords": "Child rights, Children, Consensus, Procedures, Restraint", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167660642"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s00431-023-05131-9"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
