A decade-old observation revealed a longer lifespan for CTMC compared with MMC. The precise mechanisms underlying such differential tissue persistence of mast cell subsets have not been described. In this study, we have discovered that mast cells expressing only one receptor, either Fc\u03b3RIIB or Fc\u03b3RIIIA, underwent caspase-independent apoptosis in response to IgG immune complex treatment. Lower frequencies of CTMC in mice that lacked either Fc\u03b3RIIB or Fc\u03b3RIIIA compared with WT mice were recorded, especially in aged mice. We proposed that this paradigm of Fc\u03b3R-mediated mast cell apoptosis could account for the more robust persistence of CTMC, which express both Fc\u03b3RIIB and Fc\u03b3RIIIA, than MMC, which express only Fc\u03b3RIIB. Importantly, we reproduced these results using a mast cell engraftment model, which ruled out possible confounding effects of mast cell recruitment or Fc\u03b3R expression by other cells on mast cell number regulation. In conclusion, our work has uncovered an Fc\u03b3R-dependent mast cell number regulation paradigm that might provide a mechanistic explanation for the long-observed differential mast cell subset persistence in tissues.", "keywords": "apoptosis, connective tissue mast cell, Fc\u03b3 receptor, mast cell, mucosal mast cell", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163136675"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1002/eji.202250221"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
