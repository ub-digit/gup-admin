Since both INI and dulaglutide have beneficial effects on the cerebrovascular disease (CVD), we anticipate that improved CVD will underlie the hypothesized cognitive benefits. Methods: This 12-months trial will include 80 older adults aged > 60 with MetS and MCI, randomized to 4 groups: INI/dulaglutide injection, intranasal placebo/dulaglutide injection, INI/placebo injection, and intranasal placebo/placebo injection. Feasibility of combining INI with dulaglutide will be tested by examining the ease of use of INI (20IU, twice/day) with dulaglutide (1.5 mg/week), adherence, and safety profile are the efficacy of combination therapy on global cognition and neurobiological markers: cerebral blood flow, cerebral glucose utilization, white matter hyperintensities, Alzheimer's related blood biomarkers and expression of insulin signaling proteins measured in brain-derived exosomes. Efficacy will be assessed for the intent-to-treat sample. Discussion: This feasibility study is anticipated to provide the basis for a multi-center large-scale randomized clinical trial of the cognitive benefits of the combination of INI with dulaglutide in individuals enriched for CVD and at high dementia risk.", "keywords": "Cerebral blood flow, Cognition, Dulaglutide, Intranasal insulin, Metabolic syndrome, Mild cognitive impairment", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163165132"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.mad.2023.111825"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
