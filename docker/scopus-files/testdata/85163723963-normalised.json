In vitro 2D models are commonly used to develop new treatments. However, 2D models overestimate drug efficiency, which increases the failure rate in later phase III clinical trials. New model systems that allow extensive and efficient drug screening are thus required. Three-dimensional printed hydrogels containing active components for cancer cell growth are interesting candidates for the preparation of next generation cancer cell models. Macromolecules, obtained from marine- and land-based resources, can form biopolymers (polysaccharides such as alginate, chitosan, hyaluronic acid, and cellulose) and bioactive components (structural proteins such as collagen, gelatin, and silk fibroin) in hydrogels with adequate physical properties in terms of porosity, rheology, and mechanical strength. Hence, in this study attention is given to biofabrication methods and to the modification with biological macromolecules to become bioactive and, thus, optimize 3D printed structures that better mimic the cancer cell microenvironment. Ink formulations combining polysaccharides for tuning the mechanical properties and bioactive polymers for controlling cell adhesion is key to optimizing the growth of the cancer cells.", "keywords": "3D bioprinting, biopolymers, breast cancer models, cells microenvironment", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163723963"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/bioengineering10060682"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
