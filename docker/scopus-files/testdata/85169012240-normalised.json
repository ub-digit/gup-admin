Students, teachers, and parents - who were also working from home - had to adjust to the new reality. To understand this new reality and the experiences of the students, teachers, and parents about online education we conducted a qualitative study using interviews and contextual inquiry. The data collected were thematically analyzed and discussed based on the different perspectives. The article presents a conceptual mapping of the online education experience of students, teachers, and parents in Greece and proposes a conceptual design framework as well as a set of guiding questions to support the design process for a better user experience of cross-cultural online educational platforms in similar contexts.", "keywords": "COVID-19 pandemic, Greek philosophy, HCI, intercultural interaction design, online learning, Online student experience, UCD, UI, user experience design, user interface design, UX", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169012240"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/978-3-031-34411-4_27"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60002014", "scopus-affilname": "The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Angeliki", "first_name": "Tevekeli", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-1572-6934"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6505492942"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Vasiliki", "first_name": "Mylonopoulou", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-2493-5543"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57193555600"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
