The current accepted theory is that sediments underlying oxygen-deficient (anoxic) bottom waters have low respiration rates and high OC burial efficiencies. By combining novel in situ measurements in anoxic basins with reaction-transport modelling, we demonstrate that sediments underlying anoxic bottom waters have much higher respiration rates than commonly assumed. A major proportion of the carbon respiration is concentrated in the top millimeter - the so-called 'reactive surface layer' - which is likely a feature in approximately 15% of the coastal seafloor. When re-evaluating previously published data in light of our results, we conclude that the impact of bottom-water anoxia on OC burial efficiencies in marine sediments is small. Consequently, reconstructions of past marine primary productivity in a predominantly anoxic ocean based on OC burial rates might be underestimated by up to an order of magnitude.", "keywords": "carbon cycle, geochemistry, marine sediment", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165445861"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1098/rspa.2023.0189"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
