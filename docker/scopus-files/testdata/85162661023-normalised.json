Sporadic infections in humans have been known since the 1970s. Since spring 2022 there has been a global epidemic. The large majority of the mpox cases in the ongoing epidemic have been reported in adult men, the number of infected children is small.\u00a0 The typical manifestation of mpox includes a rash that initially presents as maculopapular lesions and then develops into vesicles and eventually crusts. Transmission of the virus primarily occurs through close contact with infected individuals, particularly through contact with unhealed blisters or wounds, as well as through sexual contacts and exposure to body fluids.\u00a0 In cases of documented close contact with an infected individual, post-exposure prophylaxis is recommended and may also be administered to children whose guardians have contracted mpox.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162661023"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
