Physical therapy is still an underexplored treatment for vulvodynia. Women\u2019s experiences of their physical therapy treatment might shed light on meaningful aspects and essential keys to facilitate change. Purpose: To explore and describe women\u2019s experiences of physical therapy treatment for vulvodynia. Methods: A qualitative interview study, using qualitative content analysis. Fourteen women with a median age of 28 years and a median pain duration of 6.5 years participated. Digital interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide with open-ended questions. Results: One theme, four categories and thirteen sub-categories were developed in the analysis. The theme, \u201cTrying to become friends with your vulva,\u201d illuminate how the women approached and reconnected to their bodies in physical therapy. The treatment increased their awareness and provided explanations for their symptoms. Four categories described aspects of the theme: 1) untapped resources in a complex healthcare; 2) a matter of trust; 3) a guide to understanding your body; and 4) a new way forward but not the whole solution. Conclusion: Women with vulvodynia perceive physical therapy as a promising and yet unknown approach. Physical therapy treatment gives the opportunity to reconnect with the body and vulva in a new way, and to manage pain and muscle tension as part of a multidisciplinary treatment.", "keywords": "Dyspareunia, physical therapy modalities, provoked vestibulodynia, qualitative research, women\u00b4s health", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164925737"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/09593985.2023.2233600"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
