We aimed to evaluate the relations of exposure to such compounds in 482 pregnant women and their infants (4 months of age) with food allergy and atopic eczema diagnosed by a paediatric allergologist at 1 year of age within the Swedish birth-cohort NICE (Nutritional impact on Immunological maturation during Childhood in relation to the Environment). Urinary cadmium and erythrocyte cadmium, lead, and mercury concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), urinary inorganic arsenic metabolites by ICP-MS after separation by ion exchange chromatography, and urinary fluoride by an ion-selective electrode. The prevalence of food allergy and atopic eczema was 8 and 7%, respectively. Gestational urinary cadmium, reflecting chronic exposure, was associated with increased odds of infant food allergy (OR [95% CI]: 1.34 [1.09, 1.66] per IQR [0.08 \u03bcg/L]). Both gestational and infant urinary fluoride were associated, albeit at a statistically non-significant level, with increased atopic eczema odds (1.48 [0.98, 2.25], 1.36 [0.95, 1.95], per doubling, respectively). By contrast, gestational and infant erythrocyte lead was associated with decreased odds of atopic eczema (0.48 [0.26, 0.87] per IQR [6.6 \u03bcg/kg] and 0.38 [0.16, 0.91] per IQR [5.94 \u03bcg/kg], respectively), and infant lead with decreased odds of food allergy (0.39 [0.16, 0.93] per IQR [5.94 \u03bcg/kg]). Multivariable adjustment had marginal impact on the estimates above. After additional adjustment for fish intake biomarkers, the methylmercury associated atopic-eczema odds were considerably increased (1.29 [0.80, 2.06] per IQR [1.36 \u03bcg/kg]). In conclusion, our results indicate that gestational cadmium exposure might be associated with food allergy at 1 year of age and, possibly, early-life exposure to fluoride with atopic eczema. Further prospective and mechanistic studies are needed to establish causality.", "keywords": "Atopic eczema, Cadmium, Fluoride, Food allergy, Lead, Mercury", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165213539"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.envint.2023.108071"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
