Adequate nutritional intake is essential for maintaining physiological functions. A poor diet increases the risk of developing conditions such as obesity, osteoporosis, and/or atherosclerosis. Diet quality is also theorized to affect systemic inflammation. Dietary habits in patients with r-axSpA are largely unknown. The aims of this study were to assess dietary nutrient intake in r-axSpA patients and examine whether it differs compared to persons without r-axSpA. METHODS: r-axSpA patients (modified NY criteria) at the rheumatology clinic in Region V\u00e4sterbotten, northern Sweden, were invited to take part in the Backbone study which investigates disease severity and comorbidities. In total, 155 patients were included. Nutritional intake was assessed by the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire MiniMeal-Q. Controls were collected from the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (n\u2009=\u200930,154), a study that invited participants 50-64\u00a0years of age by random selection from the Swedish population register. Out of the 155 r-axSpA patients, 81 were in the same age span. Four controls were identified for each patient, matched on age (\u00b1\u20091\u00a0year), sex, and geographic location. Data on dietary intake was available for 319 controls. Statistical comparisons of dietary intake between patients with r-axSpA and controls were done by exact conditional logistic regression analysis, adjusted for country of birth, educational level, single household, weight, smoking status, and energy intake. RESULTS: Patients had a comparatively significantly higher energy intake from carbohydrates, a lower fiber density, and a lower intake of marine omega-3 fatty acids. Furthermore, intake of vitamins D, E, and K as well as selenium, folate, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, vitamin A, and \u03b2-carotene (a precursor of vitamin A and marker of vegetable and fruit intake) was significantly lower among patients compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that r-axSpA patients have an impaired dietary intake. Notably, intake was lower in several nutrients theorized to have anti-inflammatory properties (fiber density, marine-omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and selenium). We further propose that nutrition screening might be incorporated into the management of r-axSpA patients.", "keywords": "Ankylosing spondylitis (D013167), Axial spondyloarthritis (D000089183), Diet (D004032), Malnutrition (D044342)", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166785808"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s13075-023-03126-3"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
