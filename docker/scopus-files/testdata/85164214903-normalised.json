Here, we examine the successful approach that AstraZeneca and its internationally renowned academic partners, Karolinska Institutet and Uppsala University, implemented to fully unlock the potential of all parties in long-term, explorative, truly collaborative research programs. The underlying premises of these successful research programs are three collaborative governance mechanisms (3MCs) that are required that leverage the strengths of each organization: mutual collaboration; mutually beneficial science; and a mutual governance model with senior management involvement.", "keywords": "academic engagement, alliance management, doing science together, drug development, governance, joint publications, joint research, managing collaborations, research collaboration, university industry interaction", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164214903"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.drudis.2023.103687"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
