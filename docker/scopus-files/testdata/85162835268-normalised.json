The vertex conditions are the standard continuity and Kirchhoff assumptions in each vertex. In the case when only Kirchhoff conditions are perturbed, we can prove existence and uniqueness of a mild solution with continuous paths in the standard state space H of square integrable functions on the edges. We also show that the solution is Markov and Feller. Furthermore, assuming that the vertex values of the normalized eigenfunctions of the self-adjoint operator governing the problem are uniformly bounded, we show that the mild solution has continuous paths in the fractional domain space associated with the Hamiltonian operator, H\u03b1 for \u03b1 <14. This is the case when the Hamiltonian operator is the standard Laplacian perturbed by a potential. We also show that if noise is present in both type of vertex conditions, then the problem admits a mild solution with continuous paths in the fractional domain space H\u03b1 with \u03b1 < \u22121 only. These regularity results are the quantum graph ana-logues obtained by da Prato and Zabczyk [9] in case of a single interval and classical 4 boundary Dirichlet or Neumann noise.", "keywords": "Hamiltonian operator, quantum graph, white-noise vertex conditions", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162835268"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1214/23-EJP962"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
