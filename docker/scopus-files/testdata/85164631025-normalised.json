According to the Swedish school law, which entered into force on 1 July 2011, preschool is a separate school form and is part of the educational school system. In recent years, there has been concern that quality in Swedish preschools is declining. Studies have reported on increasing group sizes within preschools, stress among preschool teachers, child stress and a low quality of activities that require adult involvement, interaction and communication with the children in terms of teaching, which affects preschool quality (Sheridan et al., Educational Research, 56, 79-397, 2014; Williams et al., Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research, 6, 696-711. https://doi.org/10.1080/00313831.2018.1434823, 2018). Furthermore, inequality has increased and children's rights to a good and equal start in life have deteriorated (Persson & Tallberg Broman, H\u00f6g sjukfr\u00e5nvaro och \u00f6kad psykisk oh\u00e4lsa. Om dilemman i f\u00f6rskoll\u00e4rares uppdrag [High sickness absence and increased mental illness. About the dilemma in preschool teachers' assignments]. Rapport. Malm\u00f6: Avdelningen f\u00f6r kvalitet och myndighet, f\u00f6rskolef\u00f6rvaltningen, Malm\u00f6 Stad, 2019). In Sweden, education equality is viewed through the lens of 'equivalence'. This means that all children should be offered a place in high-quality preschools, and that children from any background can reach their full potential. The chapter will conclude with suggestions for moving forward to enhance preschool quality in Sweden through a deeper understanding of how early childhood education and care can support children's development and learning outcomes (Siraj et al., Asia-Pacific Journal of Research in Early Childhood Education, 13, 49-68, 2019).", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164631025"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/978-3-030-73182-3_7"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
