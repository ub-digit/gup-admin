The study aimed to compare SWE and SWD values with histopathology in pediatric liver recipients. Methods: Forty-eight pediatric liver recipients were examined with SWE in conjunction with an elective liver biopsy (clinically without complication). Additionally, SWD values were measured in 21 children. SWE and SWD values were compared to histologically determined fibrosis graded as none-to-mild (F0\u20131) and moderate-to-severe (F2\u20134), and inflammation graded as low (grade 0\u20131) and high (grade 2\u20134). Results: Two children were excluded due to SWE IQR/median > 30% kPa. The mean age across 46 included patients was 10.9 years (range 1.4\u201318). The number of patients and median (range) SWE value (kPa) for each stage of fibrosis were: F0\u20131 [n = 23; 5.8 (3.2\u201316.1)], F2 [n = 22; 6.0 (4.5\u201325.9)], F3 [n = 1; 33.3], and F4 [n = 0]. Significantly higher SWE values and greater variability were registered in F2\u20134 vs. F0\u20131 (p =.05). Grade of fibrosis correlated weakly to SWE values (r =.3; p =.05), but not to SWD values (r =.2; p =.27). In patients with low-grade inflammation, median SWD was 13.7 m/s KHz (10.7\u201317.6). Only one patient had high-grade inflammation. Conclusions: Uncomplicated transplanted liver grafts in a small pediatric cohort revealed slightly increased SWE and SWD values compared to previously reported values in healthy children. This likely reflect both the fibrotic and inflammatory elements in the grafts; however, other confounders impacting the liver's viscoelastic properties are also probable factors.", "keywords": "fibrosis, inflammation, Liver biopsy, pediatric liver transplants, shear wave dispersion, shear wave elastography", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168126631"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/petr.14591"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
