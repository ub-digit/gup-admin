A potentially invasive foraminifer (Rhizaria), Nonionella sp. T1, was recently discovered in the Skagerrak and its fjords. Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) was applied to track the spread of this non-indigenous species using a new dPCR assay (T1-1). The use of dPCR appears highly complementary to traditional hand picking of foraminiferal shells from the sediment, and is far less time-consuming. This study indicates that Nonionella sp. T1 has bypassed the outer Skagerrak strait, instead becoming established in Swedish west coast fjords, constituting up to half of the living foraminiferal community in fjord mouth areas. The ecology of Nonionella sp. T1 and its potential invasive impacts are still largely unknown, but it appears to be an opportunist using several energy sources such as nitrate respiration and kleptoplasty along with a possibly more efficient reproductive strategy to gain an advantage over the native foraminiferal species. Future ecological studies of Nonionella sp. T1 could be aided by dPCR and the novel Nonionella sp. T1-specific T1-1 assay.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164176104"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/1462-2920.16458"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
