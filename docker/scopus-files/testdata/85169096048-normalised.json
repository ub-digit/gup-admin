In the current study, we addressed the effect of TNF-\u03b1 (-308G/A) gene polymorphism on circulating TNF-\u03b1 levels following continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Methods: This study was a secondary analysis of the RICCADSA trial (NCT00519597) conducted in Sweden. CAD patients with OSA (apnea\u2013hypopnea index) of \u226515 events/h and an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of <10 were randomized to CPAP or no-CPAP groups, and OSA patients with an ESS score of \u226510 were offered CPAP treatment. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and 12-month follow-up visits. TNF-\u03b1 was measured by immunoassay (Luminex, R&D Systems). Genotyping of TNF-\u03b1-308G/A (single nucleotide polymorphism Rs1800629) was performed by polymerase chain reaction\u2013restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results: In all, 239 participants (206 men and 33 women; mean age 64.9 (SD 7.7) years) with polymorphism data and circulating levels of TNF-\u03b1 at baseline and 1-year follow-up visits were included. The median circulating TNF-\u03b1 values fell in both groups between baseline and 12 months with no significant within- or between-group differences. In a multivariate linear regression model, a significant change in circulating TNF-\u03b1 levels from baseline across the genotypes from GA to GA and GA to AA (standardized \u03b2-coefficient \u22120.129, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u22121.82; \u22120.12; p = 0.025) was observed in the entire cohort. The association was more pronounced among the individuals who were using the device for at least 4 h/night (n = 86; standardized \u03b2-coefficient \u22122.979 (95% CI \u22126.11; \u22121.21); p = 0.004)), whereas no significant association was found among the patients who were non-adherent or randomized to no-CPAP. The participants carrying the TNF-\u03b1 A allele were less responsive to CPAP treatment regarding the decline in circulating TNF-\u03b1 despite CPAP adherence (standardized \u03b2-coefficient \u22120.212, (95% CI \u22125.66; \u22121.01); p = 0.005). Conclusions: Our results suggest that TNF-\u03b1 (-308G/A) gene polymorphism is associated with changes in circulating TNF-\u03b1 levels in response to CPAP treatment in adults with CAD and OSA.", "keywords": "coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, tumor necrosis factor", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169096048"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/jcm12165325"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60006369", "scopus-affilname": "Ko\u00e7 \u00dcniversitesi", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Istanbul", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Turkey"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Yeliz", "first_name": "Celik", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57219352906"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60118584", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper, Lund", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60006369", "scopus-affilname": "Ko\u00e7 \u00dcniversitesi", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Istanbul", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Turkey"}, {"scopus-afid": "60002746", "scopus-affilname": "Harvard Medical School", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Boston", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}, {"scopus-afid": "60001361", "scopus-affilname": "University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Pittsburgh", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Y\u00fcksel", "first_name": "Peker", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-9067-6538"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6603831207"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60012311", "scopus-affilname": "Karolinska Institutet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "T\u00fclay", "first_name": "Yucel-Lindberg", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-0129-8809"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6701349899"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60010345", "scopus-affilname": "H\u00f6gskolan i Sk\u00f6vde", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Skovde", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Tilia", "first_name": "Thelander", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57242018500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60010345", "scopus-affilname": "H\u00f6gskolan i Sk\u00f6vde", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Skovde", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Afrouz", "first_name": "Behboudi", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-2525-3752"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6602555565"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
