We investigate compliant sports floors and fall-related injuries in a residential care setting and update a meta-analysis from a recent systematic review on compliant flooring. METHODS: A non-randomised study comparing outcomes in a residential care unit that installed sports flooring in bedrooms with four units with regular flooring in a Norwegian municipality (n=193). Data on falls were collected for a period of 46 months (323 falls on sports flooring; 414 on regular flooring). Outcomes were injurious falls per person bed-day, falls per person bed-day and injury risks per fall. Confounding was adjusted for using Andersen-Gill proportional hazards and log-binomial regression models. Random-effects inverse variance models were used to pool estimates. RESULTS: Injurious fall rates were 13% lower in the unit with sports flooring (adjusted HR (aHR): 0.87 (95% CI: 0.55 to 1.37)). There was limited evidence of adverse effects on fall rates (aHR: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.63 to 1.38)) and the injury risk per fall was lower in fall events that occurred on sports floors (adjusted relative risk (RR): 0.75 (95% CI: 0.53 to 1.08)). Pooling these estimates with previous research added precision, but the overall pattern was the same (pooled RR for injurious falls: 0.66 (95% CI: 0.39 to 1.12); fall rates: 0.87 (95% CI: 0.68 to 1.12); injury risks per fall: 0.71 (95% CI: 0.52 to 0.97)). CONCLUSION: Sports floors may be an alternative to novel shock-absorbing floors in care settings; however, more research is needed to improve precision.", "keywords": "environmental modification, fall, hip facture, non-randomized trial, older people, outcome evaluation", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167467011"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1136/ip-2022-044713"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60002392", "scopus-affilname": "Karlstads Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Karlstad", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60002392", "scopus-affilname": "Karlstads Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Karlstad", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Johanna", "first_name": "Gustavsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-4840-6424"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55618150000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60002392", "scopus-affilname": "Karlstads Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Karlstad", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60002392", "scopus-affilname": "Karlstads Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Karlstad", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Finn", "first_name": "Nilson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55550322900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60002392", "scopus-affilname": "Karlstads Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Karlstad", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Carl", "first_name": "Bonander", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-1189-9950"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56340631100"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
