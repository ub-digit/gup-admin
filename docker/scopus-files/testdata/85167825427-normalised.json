Hysterectomy may be combined with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, as a risk-reducing procedure to minimize the risk of ovarian cancer. An open question is whether concomitant oophorectomy, with cessation of ovarian androgen secretion, has any long-term effects on sexual function. In the present prospective cohort study of women undergoing benign hysterectomy, the long-term (10\u201312 years) effects on sexual function and changes in sex hormone levels were investigated in women having undergone perimenopausal hysterectomy, with or without concomitant bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Originally, 491 women (mean age around 50 years) were operated with (patient preference) either only hysterectomy (HYST) or hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (HYST + BSO), and 441 women (90%; HYST; n = 271 and HYST + BSO; n = 170) completed a one-year survey. In the present study, 185 women (42%) of the cohort with one-year follow up participated in the long-term follow up after 10\u201312 years. Follow-up was with the 10-item McCoy Female Sex Questionnaire and blood analysis of levels of testosterone, estradiol and sexual-hormone-binding globulin. The results showed that specific aspects of sexual function were lower after HYST + BSO compared to HYST 10\u201312 years after surgery. These lowered items were frequency of sexual fantasies, enjoyment of sexual activity, sexual arousal, and orgasmic frequency. No long-term differences in sex hormone levels were found between the two groups. In conclusion, some items related to sexual function were lower after HYST + BSO in a long-term perspective study, although the levels of testosterone were unaltered. This finding may have implications for clinical recommendations concerning prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy or for hysterectomy during the perimenopausal age.", "keywords": "hysterectomy, oophorectomy, ovary, sexuality, testosterone", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167825427"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/jcm12154976"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
