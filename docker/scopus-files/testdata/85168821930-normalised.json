The study argues for a focus on the articulations of authoritarianism to understand the dynamics of far-right discourse. Four central features of authoritarianism are identified and explored: 1) the authoritarian values underlying articulated opinions on diverse issues; 2) the emotional dimension of authoritarianism; 3) the coexistence of civil and uncivil articulations of authoritarianism; and 4) the role of mainstream news as reference for and trigger of authoritarian responses. The qualitative study is based on data from two Swedish forums, Flashback and Familjeliv [Family life], and consists of 79 threads related to three issues on the agenda: disorder in school, gang crime, and transgender. The results show expressions of authoritarian-liberal value conflicts, and, most significantly, the vigour of an authoritarian culture on the forums, with implications for the normalisation of far-right discourse.", "keywords": "authoritarianism, emotions, far-right, normalisation, online discourse", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168821930"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.2478/nor-2023-0011"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Mats", "first_name": "Ekstr\u00f6m", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57203056436"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
