Sphingolipids are not only important structural components of cellular membranes, but they are also important regulators of cellular trafficking and signal transduction and are implicated in several diseases. Here, we review the latest insights into sphingolipids and their role in cardiac function and cardiometabolic disease. RECENT FINDINGS: The underlying mechanisms linking sphingolipids to cardiac dysfunction are still not fully clarified. Sphingolipids, and in particular ceramides, have emerged as important players in lipotoxicity, mediating inflammation, impaired insulin signalling and apoptosis. In addition, recent findings highlight the importance of glycosphingolipid homeostasis in cardiomyocyte membranes, where they are required to maintain \u03b2-adrenergic signalling and contractile capacity to preserve normal heart function. Thus, glycosphingolipid homeostasis in cardiac membranes characterizes a novel mechanism linking sphingolipids to cardiac disease. SUMMARY: Modulation of cardiac sphingolipids may represent a promising therapeutic approach. Sustained investigation of the link between sphingolipids and cardiomyocyte function is therefore needed and we hope that this review may inspire researchers to further elucidate the action of these lipids.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164300033"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1097/MOL.0000000000000829"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
