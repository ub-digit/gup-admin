To explore this we analyze naturally efficacious biocorona compositions using an unbiased screening workflow. First, LNPs are complexed with plasma samples, from individual lean or obese male rats, and then functionally evaluated in vitro. Then, a fast, automated, and miniaturized method retrieves the LNPs with intact biocoronas, and multiomics analysis of the LNP-corona complexes reveals the particle corona content arising from each individual plasma sample. We find that the most efficacious LNP-corona complexes were enriched with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and, compared to the commonly used corona-biomarker Apolipoprotein E, corona HDL content was a superior predictor of in-vivo activity. Using technically challenging and clinically relevant lipid nanoparticles, these methods reveal a previously unreported role for HDL as a source of ApoE and, form a framework for improving LNP therapeutic efficacy by controlling corona composition.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164269369"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1038/s41467-023-39768-9"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
