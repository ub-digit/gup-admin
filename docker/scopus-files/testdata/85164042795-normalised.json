The term \"aerobic glycolysis\" has been coined to denote increased glucose uptake and lactate production despite normal oxygen levels and functional mitochondria. Hence, in \"aerobic glycolysis,\" lactate production is a metabolic choice, whereas in \"anaerobic glycolysis,\" it is a metabolic necessity based on inadequate levels of oxygen. Interestingly, lactate can be taken up by cells and oxidized to pyruvate and thus constitutes a source of pyruvate that is independent of insulin. Here, we show that the transcription factor Foxp1 regulates glucose uptake and lactate production in adipocytes and myocytes. Overexpression of Foxp1 leads to increased glucose uptake and lactate production. In addition, protein levels of several enzymes in the glycolytic pathway are upregulated, such as hexokinase 2, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, and lactate dehydrogenase. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and real-time quantitative PCR assays, we demonstrate that Foxp1 directly interacts with promoter consensus cis-elements that regulate expression of several of these target genes. Conversely, knockdown of Foxp1 suppresses these enzyme levels and lowers glucose uptake and lactate production. Moreover, mice with a targeted deletion of Foxp1 in muscle display systemic glucose intolerance with decreased muscle glucose uptake. In primary human adipocytes with induced expression of Foxp1, we find increased glycolysis and glycolytic capacity. Our results indicate Foxp1 may play an important role as a regulator of aerobic glycolysis in adipose tissue and muscle.", "keywords": "aerobic glycolysis, Foxp1, glucose tolerance test, glucose uptake, lactate production", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164042795"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.jbc.2023.104795"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
