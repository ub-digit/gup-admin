However, their efficacy and safety in PCOS remain unclear as previous reviews have focused on non-PCOS populations. To inform the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline in PCOS, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of hormonal and clinical features of PCOS. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, All EBM reviews, and CINAHL up to 28th June 2023 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining oral anti-androgen use, alone or in combination with metformin, COCPs, lifestyle, or other interventions, in women of any age, with PCOS diagnosed by Rotterdam, National Institutes of Health or Androgen Excess & PCOS Society criteria, and using a form of contraception. Non-English studies and studies of less than 6 months duration or which used the same anti-androgen regimen in both/all groups were excluded in order to establish efficacy for the clinical outcomes of interest. Three authors screened articles against selection criteria and assessed risk of bias and quality using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. Critical outcomes (prioritised during guideline development for GRADE purposes) included weight, body mass index (BMI), irregular cycles, hirsutism, liver function, and quality of life. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted where appropriate. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022345640. Findings: From 1660 studies identified in the search, 27 articles comprising 20 unique studies were included. Of these, 13 studies (n = 961) were pooled in meta-analysis. Seven studies had a high risk of bias, nine moderate and four low. Anti-androgens included finasteride, flutamide, spironolactone, or bicalutamide. In meta-analysis, anti-androgens + lifestyle were superior to metformin + lifestyle for hirsutism (weighted mean difference [WMD] [95% CI]: \u22121.59 [\u22123.06, \u22120.12], p = 0.03; I2 = 74%), SHBG (7.70 nmol/l [0.75, 14.66], p = 0.03; I2 = 0%), fasting insulin and fasting insulin: glucose ratio (\u22122.11 \u03bcU/ml [\u22123.97, \u22120.26], p = 0.03; I2 = 0% and \u22121.12 [\u22121.44, \u22120.79], p < 0.0001, I2 = 0%, respectively), but were not superior to placebo + lifestyle for hirsutism (\u22120.93, [\u22123.37, 1.51], p = 0.45; I2 = 76%) or SHBG (9.72 nmol/l [\u22120.71, 20.14], p = 0.07; I2 = 31%). Daily use was more effective for hirsutism than use every three days (\u22123.48 [\u22124.58, \u22122.39], p < 0.0001, I2 = 1%), and resulted in lower androstenedione levels (\u22120.30 ng/ml [\u22120.50, \u22120.10], p = 0.004; I2 = 0%). Combination treatment with anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle resulted in lower testosterone compared with metformin + lifestyle (\u22120.29 nmol/l [\u22120.52, \u22120.06], p = 0.01; I2 = 61%), but there were no differences in hirsutism when anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle were compared with either anti-androgens + lifestyle or metformin + lifestyle. In limited meta-analyses (n = 2 trials), combining anti-androgens with COCP resulted in poorer lipid profiles compared with COCP \u00b1 placebo, with no differences in other outcomes. Interpretation: Current evidence does not support the use of anti-androgens preferentially to COCPs to treat hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in PCOS, where COCPs are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or present a sub-optimal response after a minimum 6-month period, with consideration of clinical context and individual risk factors and characteristics.
