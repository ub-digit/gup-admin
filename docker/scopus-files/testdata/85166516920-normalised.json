Purpose: To compare failure and complication rates between the over-the-top (OTT) and transportal drilling (TD) techniques in patients undergoing surgery for failed revision ACLR. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: The medical records of patients with at least 2 revision ACLRs using either the OTT or TD technique were reviewed retrospectively. Data on patient demographics, graft characteristics, number of revisions, concomitant procedures, complications, and failures were collected. Between-group comparisons of continuous and categorical variables were conducted with the independent-samples t test and the Fisher exact or chi-square test, respectively. Results: A total of 101 patients undergoing multiple-revision ACLR with OTT (n = 37, 37%) and TD (n = 64, 63%) techniques were included for analysis. The mean follow-up time was 60 months (range, 12-196 months). There were no significant differences in age, sex, body mass index, laterality, or follow-up length between groups (P >.05). Allograft was the graft used most frequently (n = 64; 67.3%) with no significant differences between groups in graft diameter (P >.05). There were no statistically significant differences between groups regarding rate of concurrent medial and lateral meniscus, cartilage, or lateral extra-articular procedures (P >.05). There was also no significant66 between-group difference in complication rate (OTT: n = 2 [5.4%]; TD: n = 8 [13%]) or graft failure rate (OTT: n = 4 [11%]; TD: n = 14 [22%]) (P >.05 for both). Conclusion: The results of this study showed notably high failure and complication rates in challenging multiple-revision ACLR. Complication and failure rates were similar between techniques, demonstrating that the OTT technique is a valuable alternative that can be used in a revision ACLR, particularly as a single-stage approach when the single-stage TD technique is not possible.", "keywords": "ACLR, graft failure, multiple-revision, OTT, over-the-top-technique, revision", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166516920"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/23259671231186972"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60012603", "scopus-affilname": "Ankara \u00dcniversitesi", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Ankara", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Turkey"}, {"scopus-afid": "60012018", "scopus-affilname": "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Pittsburgh", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Emre Anil", "first_name": "\u00d6zbek", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55122094600"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60138332", "scopus-affilname": "Kepler Universit\u00e4tsklinikum", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Linz", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Austria"}, {"scopus-afid": "60103459", "scopus-affilname": "Klinikum rechts der Isar der Technischen Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Munich", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Germany"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Philipp W.", "first_name": "Winkler", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57216320712"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60012018", "scopus-affilname": "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Pittsburgh", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Ehab M.", "first_name": "Nazzal", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57215817529"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60012018", "scopus-affilname": "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Pittsburgh", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "B\u00e1lint", "first_name": "Zsidai", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57219706181"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60012018", "scopus-affilname": "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Pittsburgh", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Nicholas P.", "first_name": "Drain", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57204102896"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60012018", "scopus-affilname": "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Pittsburgh", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Janina", "first_name": "Kaarre", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57222664675"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60015543", "scopus-affilname": "University of Pittsburgh", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Pittsburgh", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "Andrew", "first_name": "Sprague", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57203575082"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60012018", "scopus-affilname": "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Pittsburgh", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "8", "last_name": "Bryson P.", "first_name": "Lesniak", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "34979974000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60012018", "scopus-affilname": "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Pittsburgh", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "9", "last_name": "Volker", "first_name": "Musahl", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6602676620"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
