The aim of this study was to analyse prognostic factors and the effects of PTR on overall survival (OS) in mCRC patients. Methods: In this population-based cohort study, factors associated with PTR and OS were assessed in 188 mCRC patients with mCRC treated with palliative chemotherapy between 2008 and 2019. The Chi-square test and Mann\u2013Whitney U-test were used to assess factors associated with PTR. The log-rank test was used to compare Kaplan\u2013Meier estimates for OS. Cox regression was used to identify factors predicting OS. Results: Patients undergoing PTR had significantly better performance status, fewer metastatic sites, lower CEA levels, and more often had left-sided CRC than patients not undergoing PTR. OS was longer in palliative mCRC patients undergoing PTR (P < 0.01) and PTR was an independent variable in the Cox regression analysis (P < 0.05). Median OS was 22.9 \u00b1 1.9 months for the PTR group and 14.5 \u00b1 1.5 months for the non-operated group. Poor performance status and liver metastases were significantly associated with poor prognosis. Conclusion: This study shows that PTR had a positive effect on OS and may be considered in patients suitable for surgery. PTR was offered to palliative mCRC patients with prognostic factors associated with better prognosis.", "keywords": "colorectal cancer, metastatic, palliative, palliative resection, surgery, survival", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165607768"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/ans.18629"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
