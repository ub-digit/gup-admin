The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical manifestations, imaging features, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants and term infants with leukomalacia. METHODS: Newborns diagnosed with leukomalacia by head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and who were admitted to intensive care units from January 2015 to June 2020 were enrolled. All infants were followed up to June 2022 (2-7\u00a0years old), and their neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated. The clinical data and long- term outcomes of preterm infants and term infants was analyzed by Chi-square tests. RESULTS: A total of 218 surviving infants with leukomalacia including 114 preterm infants and 104 term infants completed the follow-up. The major typesof leukomalacia on MRI were periventricular leukomalacia in the preterm group and subcortical cystic leukomalacia in the term group, respectively (\u03c72\u2009=\u200955.166; p\u2009<\u20090.001). When followed up to 2-7\u00a0years old, the incidence of neurodevelopmental impairment in the preterm group and term group was not significantly different (\u03c72\u2009=\u20090.917; p\u2009=\u20090.338). However, the incidence of cerebral palsy (CP) in the preterm group was significantly higher (\u03c72\u2009=\u20094.896; p\u2009=\u20090.027), while the incidence of intellectual disability (ID) (\u03c72\u2009=\u20099.445; p\u2009=\u20090.002), epilepsy (EP) (\u03c72\u2009=\u200923.049; p\u2009<\u20090.001), and CP combined with ID andEP (\u03c72\u2009=\u20094.122; p\u2009=\u20090.042) was significantly lower than that in the term group. CONCLUSIONS: Periventricular leukomalacia mainly occurred in preterm infants while subcortical cystic leukomalacia was commonly seen in term infants. Although the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of leukomalacia were both poor, preterm infants were more prone to CP, while term infants were more prone to ID, EP, and the combination of CP with ID and EP.", "keywords": "Cerebral palsy, Head MRI, Leukomalacia, Neurodevelopmental outcomes, Newborn", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166784609"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s11689-023-09489-7"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60018554", "scopus-affilname": "Zhengzhou University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Zhengzhou", "scopus-affiliation-country": "China"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Juan", "first_name": "Song", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56244234500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60018554", "scopus-affilname": "Zhengzhou University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Zhengzhou", "scopus-affiliation-country": "China"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Yuyang", "first_name": "Yue", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57226254186"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60082495", "scopus-affilname": "The Children's Hospital of Zhengzhou City", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Zhengzhou", "scopus-affiliation-country": "China"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Huiqing", "first_name": "Sun", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55798230000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60082495", "scopus-affilname": "The Children's Hospital of Zhengzhou City", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Zhengzhou", "scopus-affiliation-country": "China"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Ping", "first_name": "Cheng", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58524190000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60018554", "scopus-affilname": "Zhengzhou University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Zhengzhou", "scopus-affiliation-country": "China"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Falin", "first_name": "Xu", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7401695213"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60018554", "scopus-affilname": "Zhengzhou University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Zhengzhou", "scopus-affiliation-country": "China"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Bingbing", "first_name": "Li", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57212172128"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "118258719", "scopus-affilname": "The First People's Hospital of Zhengzhou", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Zhengzhou", "scopus-affiliation-country": "China"}], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "Kenan", "first_name": "Li", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57211210685"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60018554", "scopus-affilname": "Zhengzhou University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Zhengzhou", "scopus-affiliation-country": "China"}, {"scopus-afid": "60012311", "scopus-affilname": "Karolinska Institutet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "8", "last_name": "Changlian", "first_name": "Zhu", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-5029-6730"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57935197700"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
