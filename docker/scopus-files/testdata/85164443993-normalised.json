Creating a citizenship regime has been a central objective of the organisation's institutional framework but previous research has refrained from examining its multiplicity. The paper uses the concept of citizenship regime consisting of the dimensions rights, access, belonging and responsibility mix as the conceptual lens and draws on institutional documents and primary data from interviews conducted at the ECOWAS Commission. The paper contributes to current debates in citizenship studies and African regionalism and the literature on supra-national citizenship building, regional integration and governance research in Africa and elsewhere. The empirical data show that movement is central to the ECOWAS citizenship regime, whether formulated in terms of a right, as a way to facilitate access, or a way to establish a sense of regional belonging.", "keywords": "free movement, international bureaucrats, regional governance, regional integration, West Africa", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164443993"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1017/S0022278X22000507"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
