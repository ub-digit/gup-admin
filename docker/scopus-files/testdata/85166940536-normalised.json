However, effects of dietary protein interventions on (gut-derived) metabolites in T2D remains understudied. We therefore performed a multi-center, randomized-controlled, isocaloric protein intervention with 151 participants following either 12-week high-protein (HP; 30Energy %, N = 78) vs. low-protein (LP; 10 Energy%, N = 73) diet. Primary objectives were dietary effects on glycemic control which were determined via glycemic excursions, continuous glucose monitors and HbA1c. Secondary objectives were impact of diet on gut microbiota composition and -derived metabolites which were determined by shotgun-metagenomics and mass spectrometry. Analyses were performed using delta changes adjusting for center, baseline, and kidney function when appropriate. This study found that a short-term 12-week isocaloric protein modulation does not affect glycemic parameters or weight in metformin-treated T2D. However, the HP diet slightly worsened kidney function, increased alpha-diversity, and production of potentially harmful microbiota-dependent metabolites, which may affect host metabolism upon prolonged exposure.", "keywords": "Dietary supplement, Health sciences, Human metabolism, Microbiome", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166940536"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.isci.2023.107471"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
