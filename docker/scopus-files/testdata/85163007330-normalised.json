Sometimes, however, they tolerate mass protests and even give in to protesters\u2019 demands. While the effect of coercion on mobilization is well-studied, we know less about the role of concession-making. We argue that accommodating demands is rarely an effective strategy in demobilizing opposition movements. Authoritarian rulers are usually neither willing nor able to fully address protesters\u2019 dynamic demands, nor can they offer credible commitments. We conduct a quantitative analysis using multiple cross-national data sets to empirically assess the relationship between concessions by the government and subsequent mass mobilization. By analyzing protest events in temporal and spatial proximity, we estimate the effect of making concessions on protest mobilization at the subnational level in 18 autocracies from 1991 to 2012. Our results indicate that concessions are associated with a significant and substantive increase in subsequent protest activity.", "keywords": "concessions, non-democratic regimes, protest, social movements", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163007330"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/00104140231169022"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
