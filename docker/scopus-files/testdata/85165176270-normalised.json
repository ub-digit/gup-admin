Design: Retrospective study of 228 bone-anchored hearing implants in 200 patients, performed over a 10-year period between 2012 and 2022 in a referral hospital. Method: Real-world data of demography, etiology, surgical setup, complications, and audiological outcomes were collected. Eligibility criteria from clinical practice were applied. Results: The minimally invasive technique is associated with shorter surgery duration, 20 vs. 44\u2005min as compared to a linear incision technique. The minimally invasive technique was also associated with a lower occurrence of complications when compared to linear incision techniques (intraoperative; 1.8% vs. 4.9%, postoperative; 49% vs. 66%). Most differences were seen in complications relating to skin and wound healing. Conclusion: Adoption of a minimally invasive surgical technique for the installations of bone-anchored hearing implants can reduce surgical complexity without compromising safety aspects or clinical benefits.", "keywords": "bone conduction implant, bone-anchored hearing system (BAHS), minimally invasive surgery, osseointegrated hearing aid, ponto, real-world data", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165176270"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3389/fsurg.2023.1209927"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
