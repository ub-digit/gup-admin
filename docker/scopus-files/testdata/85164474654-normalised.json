Design, setting and subjects: This qualitative study used a semi-structured interview format based on functional behavioural analysis as commonly used in cognitive behavioural therapy. We interviewed eight participants and analysed their responses using systematic text condensation. Results: Participants\u2019 descriptions of their experiences and management of pain from episodic migraine were sorted into three description First physical sensations, Automatic reactions and Acts according to the interpretation. Conclusion: From a biopsychosocial perspective, a migraine attack is much more complex than just an experience of pain. The purely biological pain prompts a number of automatic reactions leading to strategies for pain management.", "keywords": "applied behaviour analysis, biopsychosocial model, chronic pain, Migraine disorders, pain management, qualitative research", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164474654"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/02813432.2023.2231034"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
