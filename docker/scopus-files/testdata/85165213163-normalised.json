The sample consists of pianists\u2019, violinists\u2019 and cellists\u2019 (N = 269) personal but public Instagram accounts. Described as unpaid, visibility, relational and aspirational labour, professionals, amateurs and individuals between these poles are making use of the platform\u2019s communication possibilities to share their musical lives. A thematic analysis of the profile strategies focused on the communicators\u2019 institutional roles, account strategies and platform-specific formats indicated that musicians communicate on Instagram in different professional positionings that imply different communicative strategies, while the platform-specific formats used in communication are rather the same across categories. The uses can be characterized as a virtual \u2018side stage\u2019\u2013a staged and mediated space that differs from the public frontstage and private backstage.", "keywords": "aspirational labour, Instagram, Musicians, platformized cultural production, recreational labour, relational labour", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165213163"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/10304312.2023.2234109"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
