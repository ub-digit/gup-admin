As a result, issues of health have been foregrounded much more clearly in the teaching of PE. The aim of this study was to explore how Swedish PE teachers make sense of health in relation to their teaching practices. This was done through investigating conceptions and theories about health in the teachers' descriptions of their teaching practices. Design/methodology/approach: The data analyzed in this paper were collected through focus group and individual interviews with PE teachers in the grades 7\u20139 within compulsory schools in Sweden. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings: Four dominant themes were identified in the data: 1) Health as a healthy attitude, 2) Health as a functional ability, 3) Health as fitness, 4) Health as mental wellbeing. There is a clear impact from healthism and obesity discourses on the teachers' accounts of health, but there is also an impact from holistic views and approaches to health. The authors contend that teachers should be explicit in what they mean by health in relation to what they teach, how they teach and why they teach health in a certain way. Originality/value: The knowledge produced by this study is crucial since teachers' assumptions regarding health affect the subject content (what), the pedagogies (how), as well as the reasons (why) they teach health and therefore what students learn regarding health.", "keywords": "Conceptions of health, Interviews, Physical education, Subject content, Thematic analysis", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166414182"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1108/HE-11-2022-0086"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Peter", "first_name": "Korp", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-7258-9967"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "12243652800"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60159450", "scopus-affilname": "Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Mikael", "first_name": "Quennerstedt", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-8748-8843"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "24477993200"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60008141", "scopus-affilname": "\u00d6rebro Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Orebro", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Dean", "first_name": "Barker", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "36982974300"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60015017", "scopus-affilname": "H\u00f6gskolan V\u00e4st", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Trollhattan", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Anna", "first_name": "Johansson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56523943200"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
