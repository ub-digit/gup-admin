While aluminium is one of the most abundant elements in the Earth's crust, gallium and indium are present only in trace amounts. However, the increased use of the latter metals in novel technologies may result in increased human and environmental exposure. There is mounting evidence that these metals are toxic, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Likewise, little is known about how cells protect themselves from these metals. Aluminium, gallium, and indium are relatively insoluble at neutral pH, and here we show that they precipitate in yeast culture medium at acidic pH as metal-phosphate species. Despite this, the dissolved metal concentrations are sufficient to induce toxicity in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By chemical-genomic profiling of the S. cerevisiae gene deletion collection, we identified genes that maintain growth in the presence of the three metals. We found both shared and metal-specific genes that confer resistance. The shared gene products included functions related to calcium metabolism and Ire1/Hac1-mediated protection. Metal-specific gene products included functions in vesicle-mediated transport and autophagy for aluminium, protein folding and phospholipid metabolism for gallium, and chorismate metabolic processes for indium. Many of the identified yeast genes have human orthologues involved in disease processes. Thus, similar protective mechanisms may act in yeast and humans. The protective functions identified in this study provide a basis for further investigations into toxicity and resistance mechanisms in yeast, plants, and humans.", "keywords": "aluminium, chemical-genomic profiling, gallium, indium, toxicity, yeast", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163076831"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1093/mtomcs/mfad032"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
