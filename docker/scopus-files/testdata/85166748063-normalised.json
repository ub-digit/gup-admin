Hence, digital education and its governance becomes a major arena for addressing inequalities. In this paper, we offer a cross-country and multi-voiced perspective on how socio-digital inequalities are problematized in digital education policy in three world regions\u2013Latin America, Africa and Europe\u2013studying cases through policy documents in Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, Botswana, Germany and Sweden. Our analysis shows how differences and similarities between digital education policy are rooted in various sociotechnical imaginaries that go beyond the national as they are highly situated in spatial\u2013temporal contexts and rooted in historical trajectories. Our contribution aims at a further exploration of the entanglements of educational technology and in/equalities through global conditions and local (hi)stories.", "keywords": "digital education, Digital inequalities, digital policies, global and local entanglements, sociotechnical imaginaries", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166748063"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/17439884.2023.2237870"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
