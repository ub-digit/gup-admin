We formulate the discretized problem using a new type of entropy-regularized multimarginal optimal transport problems where the cost is a decomposable structured tensor. A novel algorithm for solving such problems is derived, using this structure and leveraging recent results in entropy-regularized optimal transport. The algorithm is then demonstrated on a numerical example in robot coordination problem for search and rescue, where three different types of robots are used to cover a given area at minimal cost.", "keywords": "Computational methods, Costs, Fluid flow systems, Games, Large-scale systems, Mathematical models, Optimization, Robot kinematics, Sociology, Statistics, Stochastic optimal control, Tensors", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163450448"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1109/LCSYS.2023.3289050"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
