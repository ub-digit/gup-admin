In this article, I survey the organization of information in Jaw\u0101mi' al-ladhdha and discuss its contribution to Arab-Islamic scholarship. I argue that the author and his intended readers lived in the second half of the fourth/ tenth century. The organization of sexual knowledge was part of the scholarly pursuit to organize the massive amount of pre-Islamic scholarship translated into Arabic during the Abbasid caliphate as well as the growing body of Arabic-Islamic scholarship. Although the presentation of this knowledge varies in the extant manuscript copies of the book, which were written for later audiences, all manuscripts share some basic tools for navigating the content, which suggests that the author made efforts to make it accessible for readers.", "keywords": "'ilm al-b\u0101h, Adab, Buyids, encyclopaedias, erotic literature, medicine, sexuality", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168942024"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1163/22142371-12340059"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Pernilla", "first_name": "Myrne", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57205619201"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
