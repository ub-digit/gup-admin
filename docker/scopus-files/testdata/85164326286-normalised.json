Because of the difficulty in delimiting this vegetation type, measuring biodiversity patterns is challenging. Here, we compared the application of two methods using spatial data to estimate angiosperm diversity in campos de altitude: (1) filtering occurrence data by elevation, canopy height, location and keywords and; (2) the same as the first, however, adding a filter of \u201ccampos de altitude\u201d in the vegetation type of the Flora e Funga do Brasil database. Also, we discuss conservation status, plant collections, endemism, vegetation data and similarity among 14 sites harboring campos de altitude. Our two resulting lists indicated between 1087 and 2398 angiosperm species and infraspecific\u00a0taxa in campos de altitude, mostly belonging to Asteraceae and Poaceae and endemic to Brazil. Extrapolations of species richness suggest a potential number of up to 4000 species. Of the taxa assessed for conservation status, 53\u201365% are threatened or near threatened. The flora of campos de altitude is more similar on closely located mountains rather than on mountains with similar geological characteristics and origin. We provide an editable list online destined to seek help from taxonomists to generate a more accurate species list, to support advances in knowledge on this unique tropical montane ecosystem.", "keywords": "Beta-diversity, Biogeography, Conservation, Grassland, Mountain, Similarity analyses", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164326286"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s00035-023-00298-1"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
