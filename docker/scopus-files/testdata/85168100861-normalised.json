This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effect of the head-lift exercise (HLE) over 12\u00a0months in HNC patients with radiation-induced dysphagia. Methods: Sixty-one patients with dysphagia were randomized to intervention group (n = 30) and control group (n = 31) at 6\u201336\u00a0months after completion of radiotherapy for HNC. Dysphagia-specific HRQL was measured with the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI); general and HNC-specific HRQL was measured with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and QLQ-H&N35. Measurements were made at baseline, and at 8\u00a0weeks and 12\u00a0months after start of intervention. Results: Adherence to the intervention was good throughout the year. When comparing change from baseline reports to each follow-up no statistically significant differences between the groups were found in any of the HRQL instruments. There were some statistically significant changes within groups compared to baseline. The intervention group improved self-rated swallowing function on the MDADI at 8\u00a0weeks (emotional domain, p = 0.03; functional domain, p = 0.007; total score, p = 0.01) and the control at twelve months (emotional domain, p = 0.03; functional domain, p = 0.02; physical domain, p = 0.004; total score, p = 0.002). Conclusion: In this randomized control study, no effect was observed short term or at 12\u00a0months on HRQL after use of the HLE as rehabilitation for radiation-induced dysphagia.", "keywords": "Dysphagia, Head and neck cancer, Head-lift exercise, Health-related quality of life, Radiotherapy, Randomized controlled trial", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168100861"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s00405-023-08183-7"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
