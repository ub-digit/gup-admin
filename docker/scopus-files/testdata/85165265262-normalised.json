Previous research shows that educators display an insecurity as well as a lack of knowledge of how to implement this dual undertaking. This article examines educators\u2019 dual undertaking of linguistic diversity (changeability), on the one hand, and a national standard (stability) on the other, based on ethnographic data from three preschools with socioeconomic differences. The data are analysed employing concepts from pedagogic theory and linguistic diversity. Bernstein\u2019s competence model with weak classification and framing accommodates translanguaging, giving room for the children\u2019s own linguistic initiatives. Translanguaging is understood from a local as well as a global perspective; the local is based on global norms and global norms relate to local practices. The results show that educators support children as linguistic and multilingual beings. Unlike previous studies showing that middle-class children benefit from the competence model, this study shows how children with different socio-economic backgrounds benefit from the competence model. The diversity of language practice in Swedish pre-schools has the potential to create opportunities for new forms of agency and identity for children.", "keywords": "diversity, pedagogic practice, preschool, translanguaging", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165265262"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/20436106231176964"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
