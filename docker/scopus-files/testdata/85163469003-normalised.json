This experiment allows for efficient multi-electron-ion coincidence measurements, and thus for following the Auger cascade step by step in detail. Dominant decay pathways leading to Ar4+ final states via Ar3+ intermediate states have been assigned with the help of theoretical ab initio calculations. The weak correlated decay of the two core holes by emission of a single Auger electron, leading to Ar3+ final states, has been observed at 458.5-eV kinetic energy. Compared to the total decay of the 2p-2 double core vacancies, this two-electron-one-electron process was measured to have a branching ratio of 1.9\u00d710-3\u00b11.0\u00d710-3. Furthermore, the remaining decay paths of the Ar1+(1s-1) core hole to higher charge states and their respective contributions to the total yield have been analyzed and show very good agreement with theoretical results.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163469003"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1103/PhysRevA.107.063108"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
