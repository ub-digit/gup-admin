Physical activity can be useful in both preventing and treating mild to moderate depression, but few studies have explored patients\u2019 experience of physical activity. Purpose: To explore experiences of facilitators to initiate and maintain regular physical activity in people with depression. Methods: Adults of working age with mild to moderate depression participated in semi-structured interviews. Two researchers analyzed the data using qualitative content analysis. Results: Four categories were identified: 1) Getting over the threshold; 2) Hoping for improvement; 3) A wish to be independent but needing help; and 4) Feeling safe on one\u2019s own terms. Conclusion: The results indicate that knowledge and personal experience of how physical activity affects well-being, and an environment including social support, increase the possibilities for people with depression to initiate and maintain physical activity. To promote physical activity, it is important to be receptive to the person\u2019s experiences, desires, and needs and to involve them in the planning and adjustment of physical activity. Follow-up appointments, a stepwise approach, and encouragement are important to increase motivation.", "keywords": "depressive disorders, motivation, Physical activity, physiotherapy, qualitative research", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168900256"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/09593985.2023.2251051"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "130115252", "scopus-affilname": "Falck Health and Work Life", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Maria", "first_name": "Bj\u00f6rkman", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58551665100"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Louise", "first_name": "Danielsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55886708200"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
