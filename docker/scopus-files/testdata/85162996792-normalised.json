Method: A three-month follow-up study, from an intervention using CO-OP. Thirty-four children (7\u201316 years) each identified four goals (one untrained to examine transfer) and participated in an eleven-session intervention. Assessments were performed at baseline, immediately after the intervention and at a three-month follow-up using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure and the Performance Quality Rating Scale. Executive function and self-rated competence were assessed at the same timepoints. Results: Statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in goal achievement were demonstrated for both trained and untrained goals after the intervention and were maintained at follow-up. The clinically relevant improvement in untrained goals continued to increase until follow-up. Self-rated competence increased after the intervention and was maintained at follow-up. Conclusion: The CO-OP intervention was effective in achieving and maintaining the children\u2019s own goals over time. The transfer effect was confirmed by higher goal attainment for the untrained goals.", "keywords": "Cerebral palsy, CO-OP approach, executive function, goal-directed, metacognition, person-centred intervention, spina bifida, transfer effect", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162996792"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/09638288.2023.2225875"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
