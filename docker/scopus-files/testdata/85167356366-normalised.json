However, the variations in the strengths of these phenomena between different months remain unclear. Here the monthly changes in observed NSWS from 769 stations across China during 1979\u20132020 were analyzed. The analysis reveals a consistent decline in NSWS that ceased around 2011, followed by an increasing trend detected in all months except March, where a distinct hiatus is observed. The hiatus in March NSWS is primarily attributed to a significant reduction in NSWS over North and Northwest China. This reduction can be linked to the southward shift of the East Asian subtropical jet (EASJ), which resulted in a decreased meridional temperature gradient and weakened transient eddy activities across northern China. These findings emphasize the importance of considering changes in the EASJ to gain a comprehensive understanding of NSWS changes at regional scale.", "keywords": "China, monthly change, near-surface wind speed, observation, synoptic transient activities, upper-level process", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167356366"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1029/2023GL104230"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
