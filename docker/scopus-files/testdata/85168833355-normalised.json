More than 90% of the human population worldwide is infected. The primary infection is usually asymptomatic in childhood, whereas infectious mononucleosis (IM) is common when the infection occurs in adolescence. Primary EBV infection, with or without IM, or reactivation of latent infection in immunocompromised individuals have been associated with a wide range of neurologic conditions, such as encephalitis, meningitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and cerebellitis. EBV is also involved in malignant lymphomas in the brain. An increasing number of reports on EBV-related disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) including the convincing association with multiple sclerosis (MS) have put in focus EBV-related conditions beyond its established link to malignancies. In this review, we present the clinical manifestations of EBVrelated CNS-disorders, put them in the context of known EBV biology and focus on available treatment options and future therapeutic approaches.", "keywords": "central nervous system disease, Epstein-Barr virus, infectious mononucleosis, multiple sclerosis, treatment, vaccination", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168833355"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.2147/IDR.S375624"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Oluf", "first_name": "Andersen", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "26321426800"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60012311", "scopus-affilname": "Karolinska Institutet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Ingemar", "first_name": "Ernberg", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-6518-1648"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7006103048"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60012311", "scopus-affilname": "Karolinska Institutet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Anna Karin", "first_name": "Hedstr\u00f6m", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-6612-4749"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "26025605600"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
