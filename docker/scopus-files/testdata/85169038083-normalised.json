This criterion-related validity study examines whether a work sample test can predict behaviors more than 6 months later among managers (N = 127) in a large municipal organization. Ratings from both the subordinates (SOR) and supervisors (SVR) of the managers were used as criteria for the leadership dimensions of Influencing others, Consideration, and Planning. In total, six hypotheses were tested. The results were corrected for range restriction in the predictors and for unreliability in the criteria. The hypothesis that the work sample test score of Consideration predicted subordinates' ratings of Consideration received full support ((Formula presented.) = 0.33; CI [0.06\u20130.56]). The Consideration work sample test score also showed a positive relationship with supervisor ratings of Consideration ((Formula presented.) = 0.22; CI [\u22120.01 to 0.43]), although the confidence interval includes zero. No significant criterion-related validity was found for Influencing others or Planning. Given the results, the work sample test can primarily be used to predict Consideration. The results are discussed, and suggestions for further research are provided.", "keywords": "consideration, Managerial behaviors, predictive validity, subordinate ratings, supervisor ratings, work sample test", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169038083"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/sjop.12954"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60028378", "scopus-affilname": "Stockholms universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Anders", "first_name": "Sj\u00f6berg", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-0736-9225"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7006608923"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Martin", "first_name": "Grill", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-6185-9992"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57193535245"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
