This study aimed to compare patient-reported core outcomes in patients reconstructed with deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flaps and latissimus dorsi (LD) flaps. Second, breast-related factors that the patients were particularly satisfied/dissatisfied with were analyzed. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study, which includes women who had undergone mastectomy and radiation, followed by delayed breast reconstructions with either LD flap and implant or DIEP flap during 2007-2017. The patient-reported core outcomes of overall breast-specific quality of life, normality, women's cosmetic satisfaction, self-esteem, emotional well-being, and physical well-being were analyzed using BREAST-Q. RESULTS: The patients were divided into LD and implant (n = 135 patients) and DIEP (n = 118 patients) groups, and both were demographically similar. The median follow-up was 8 years. The DIEP group scored significantly higher than the LD and implant group in five out of six domains. A high satisfaction was reported in questions regarding the feeling or appearance when having clothes on, whereas the greatest dissatisfaction was reported regarding questions entailing symmetry and the appearance without clothes. CONCLUSION: After 7 years, patients' breast-specific quality of life, normality, women's cosmetic satisfaction, self-esteem, emotional well-being, and physical well-being seem to be higher in irradiated patients who have been reconstructed with DIEP flap as compared to patients reconstructed with LD flap and implant. In both groups, patient satisfaction is high regarding their appearance when clothed, whereas the lowest satisfaction scores were reported in situations without clothing.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168582871"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.2340/jphs.v58.12417"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Jonas", "first_name": "L\u00f6fstrand", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57195759065"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Anna", "first_name": "Paganini", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57193385115"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Mattias", "first_name": "Lid\u00e9n", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "15056484300"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Emma", "first_name": "Hansson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57087991300"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
