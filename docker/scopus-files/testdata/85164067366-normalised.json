Though it is acknowledged that bridging the gap between healthcare settings and community settings may be necessary to reach those requiring extra support. Open preschool (OP) is a low threshold community setting which parents with their young children can visit voluntarily, where the various activities offered can be opportunities to address topics related to food and health. The aim of this study is to explore preschool teachers and health practitioners' thoughts and experience of OP as a setting for health promotion, with focus on food and eating. The study is localized to OP's in a multicultural district in Gothenburg, Sweden. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with three preschool teachers and seven health practitioners (one dental hygienist, three dietitians and three public health strategists). With an inductive approach, data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. From the perspective of teachers and health practitioners, the findings indicate that OP can be a setting for mutual learning in a supportive environment. OP provides various possibilities for improved FL and HL by linking health practitioners with families, providing the opportunity to socialize and by eating together. The results also reveal that language barriers can sometimes hinder communication, and that OP does not reach all families. Continuous collaboration between OP and health organizations and practitioners along with regular use of intercultural mediators is recommended by the professionals.", "keywords": "family, food literacy, health literacy, healthy eating, settings approach", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164067366"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1093/heapro/daac030"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
