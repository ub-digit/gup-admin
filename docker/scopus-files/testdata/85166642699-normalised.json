We explore this question in a comparison of experiences with marketisation\u2014a key doctrine in the NPM\u2014within local park and road services in England, Sweden, Denmark and Norway. The comparison draws upon survey data collected from mid-level managers in 2014\u201316. We conclude that although marketisation is widespread it is not dominant. Also, the practices of marketisation are partly transformed by newer reform trends. In perspective, we find that marketisation is an evolving practice, which trajectories depend on local contextual circumstances and adaption of newer reform ideas.", "keywords": "England, Marketisation, Municipalities, New Public Management, Post-NPM, Scandinavia", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166642699"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/978-3-030-56059-1_12"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
