Life cycle assessments of domestic laundering are no exception. However, potential discrepancies between self-reported behaviour and actual everyday decisions are seldom investigated due to practical challenges in collecting relevant data. This means that environmental impacts relying on such self-reported data are much more uncertain than previously acknowledged. Method: Laundering data was collected at the Chalmers\u2019 HSB Living lab (CHSBLL), a combined multi-family house and research facility in Gothenburg. The collection was both done passively (through the washing machines) as well as actively (through surveys to the tenants). RFID-readers were also installed in the machines and a number of clothing items tagged, allowing for identification. The site-specific data was later supplemented with a large statistical representative study for domestic laundering of Swedish households. This unique data quality allowed the comparison of passively collected data with survey data from tenants in a real-life setup, while validating the results from a national perspective. Result and conclusions: The results suggest that consumers have trouble remembering personal choices regarding domestic laundering, meaning that self-reported data are more uncertain than previously thought. In general, the participants overestimated the amount of laundry they washed and underestimated their frequency of washing. Additionally, many participants showed an interest in changing to alternative wash programs although this change failed to materialize when they were presented with this option in real-life. The findings have potential consequences for environmental assessments and implicate those previous estimations underestimate emissions per kg laundry washed.", "keywords": "Consumer behaviour, Environmental assessments, Household consumption, Laundry, Living lab, RFID", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162867025"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s11367-023-02189-3"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
