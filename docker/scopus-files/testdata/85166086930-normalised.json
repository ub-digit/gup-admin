Hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets are lesser utilized than other 2D nanostructures in electrochemistry and electrochemical sensing due to their unsuitable electrical conductivity. Recent studies have determined that high specific surface area, the presence of many active edges, the possibility of tunning the bandgap through interactions with other nanomaterials, and chemical motifs result in enhanced catalytic activity and conductivity. Therefore, 2D h-BN becomes a promising modifier for electroanalytical sensing applications. Herein, we present the recent progress in 2D hexagonal boron nitride-based electrochemical sensors with a focus on their applications in environment, drug, and biological samples analysis. The current challenges and prospects of 2D heterostructure-based sensors are addressed.", "keywords": "Electrocatalytic activity, Electrochemical sensors, Hybrid materials, Surface functionalization, Two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166086930"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/B978-0-443-15293-1.00008-2"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
