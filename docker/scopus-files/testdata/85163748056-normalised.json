The setup is based on the AC Josephson effect between bulk superconductors and mechanically vibrating mesoscopic superconducting island in the regime of the Cooper pair box. Starting with a pure state with quantum information initially encoded into superposition of the Cooper pair box states, applying a specially tailored time-protocol upon bias voltage and gate electrodes, we obtain a new pure state with information finally encoded into superposition of nanomechanical coherent states constituting the cat-state. This performance is achieved using quantum entanglement between electrical and mechanical states. Nanomechanical cat-states serve as a \u201cstorage\u201d of quantum information, motivated by significantly longer decoherence time with respect to the charge qubit states, from which the information can be transdued back to the charge qubit applying the reverse time-protocol.", "keywords": "AC Josephson effect, Cooper pair box qubit, Nanoelectromechanical systems, Nanomechanical cat-states, Superconducting nanomechanics, Transduction of quantum information", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163748056"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.physb.2023.415049"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
