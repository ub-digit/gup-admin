Objective: To identify clusters of adult-onset asthma in a Finnish population-based study on subjects born before 1967. Methods: We used population-based data from 1350 asthmatics with adult-onset asthma (Adult Asthma in Finland) from Finnish national registers. Twenty-eight covariates were selected based on literature. The number of covariates was reduced by using factor analysis before cluster analysis. Results: Five clusters (CLU1-CLU5) were identified, 3 clusters with late-onset adult asthma (onset \u226540 years) and 2 clusters with onset at earlier adulthood (<40 years). Subjects in CLU1 (n = 666) had late-onset asthma and were nonobese, symptomatic, and predominantly female with few respiratory infections during childhood. CLU2 (n = 36) consisted of subjects who had earlier-onset asthma, were predominantly female, obese with allergic asthma, and had recurrent respiratory infections. Subjects in CLU3 (n = 75) were nonobese, older, and predominantly men with late-onset asthma, smoking history, comorbidities, severe asthma, least allergic diseases, low education, many siblings, and childhood in rural areas. CLU4 (n = 218) was a late-onset cluster consisting of obese females with comorbidities, asthma symptoms, and low education level. Subjects in CLU5 (n = 260) had earlier onset asthma, were nonobese, and predominantly allergic females. Conclusions: Our population-based adult-onset asthma clusters take into account several critical factors such as obesity and smoking, and identified clusters that partially overlap with clusters identified in clinical settings. Results give us a more profound understanding of adult-onset asthma phenotypes and support personalized management.", "keywords": "Adult-onset asthma, Cluster analysis, Factor analysis, Population-based research", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162894532"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.jaip.2023.05.034"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
