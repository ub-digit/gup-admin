The aim of this trial was to explore and evaluate an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS\u00ae) and prehabilitation protocol in patients undergoing open pancreatic surgery. Methods: Three groups of patients were included: two prospective series of 75 patients undergoing open pancreatic surgery following an ERAS\u00ae protocol with or without prehabilitation, and one group of 55 historical controls. Variables regarding adherence to, and effects of the protocols, were collected from the local database and the patients\u2019 hospital records. Patients\u2019 adherence to advice given pre-operatively was followed up using a study-specific questionnaire. Results: The patients reported high adherence to remembered advice given. The health care professionals\u2019 adherence to the various parts of the concepts varied. ERAS\u00ae implementation resulted in more frequent gut motility stimulation (p < 0.001) and shorter duration of epidural anesthesia, site drains, and urinary catheter (p = 0.001). With prehabilitation, more patients were screened concerning nutritional status and prescribed preoperative training (p < 001). There was a significant change in weight before surgery, a shorter time to first flatus and a shorter length of stay after implementation of the concepts (p < 0.05). Complications were rare in all three groups and there were no significant differences between the groups. Conclusion: The implementation of an ERAS\u00ae and a prehabilitation protocol increased adherence to the protocols by both patients and healthcare professionals. An implementation of an ERAS\u00ae protocol with and without prehabilitation decreases length of stay and may decrease preoperative weight loss and time to bowel movement.", "keywords": "Adherence, complications, ERAS \u00ae, nutrition, pancreas, respiratory muscle training, surgery", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165370393"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/14574969231186274"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
