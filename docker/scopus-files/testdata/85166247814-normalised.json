Since gender is highly relevant for both attitudes towards transport policy as well as political votes, data on the gender and political colour of executives (members of presidiums) of transport-related committees, councils, and boards is analysed. The study is aimed at the local level, since municipal transport policy decisions include areas with clear differences between masculinity and femininity norms. The mapping of representation reveals, in line with other studies, that women are underrepresented in the most leading position (as chairperson of the City Board 31\u201337%), and that presidiums of transport-related committees, especially, are highly dominated by men (72\u201374%) with no clear positive trend in female representation identified over the studied years. The result suggests that transport-related decisions are disproportionally shaped by men as well as masculine norms, with implications for the transition towards transport sustainability.", "keywords": "gender, municipality, representation, sustainability, Sweden, transport", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166247814"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/su151411280"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60029170", "scopus-affilname": "Lunds Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Lena Winslott", "first_name": "Hiselius", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-8376-5743"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6507201120"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Annica", "first_name": "Kronsell", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-1991-8543"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6507658036"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60273457", "scopus-affilname": "Trivector AB", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Lena Smidfelt", "first_name": "Rosqvist", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-6702-618X"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6507211665"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60273457", "scopus-affilname": "Trivector AB", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Christian", "first_name": "Dym\u00e9n", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55555435400"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60107281", "scopus-affilname": "RISE Research Institutes of Sweden AB", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Olga", "first_name": "Stepanova", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-0146-2296"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55613498100"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
