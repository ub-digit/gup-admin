Little is known about the cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) appearance of GCM and the methods ability to distinguish the two rare entities from one another. Methods: We assessed a total of 40 patients with endomyocardial biopsy-proven GCM (n = 14) and CS (n = 26) concerning their clinical and CMR appearance in a blinded manner. Results: Patients with GCM and CS were of similar median age (55 vs 56 years), and a male predominance was observed in both groups. In GCM, median levels of troponin T (313 vs 31 ng/L, p < 0.001), and natriuretic peptides (6560 vs 676 pg/mL, p < 0.001) were higher than in CS, and the clinical outcome worse (p = 0.04). On CMR imaging, the observed alterations of left and right ventricular (LV/RV) dimensions and function were similar. GCM showed multifocal LV late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with a similar longitudinal, circumferential, and radial distribution as in CS, including suggested signature imaging biomarkers of CS like the \u201chook sign\u201d (71% vs 77%, p = 0.702). The median LV LGE enhanced volume was 17% and 22% in GCM and CS (p = 0.150), respectively. The number of RV segments with pathologically increased T2 signal and/or LGE were most extensive in GCM. Conclusions: The CMR appearance of both GCM and CS is highly similar, making the differentiation between the two rare entities solely based on CMR challenging. This stands in contrast to the clinical appearance, which seems to be more severe in GCM.", "keywords": "Cardiac sarcoidosis, Cardiovascular magnetic resonance, Giant cell myocarditis, Inflammatory cardiomyopathy, Myocarditis", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163475700"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2023.131143"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
