Such a molecular dication was produced by double photoionization with synchrotron radiation in the 24\u201370 eV photon energy range. The experiment has been conducted at the Elettra Synchrotron Facility of Basovizza (Trieste, Italy) using a light beam linearly polarized with the direction of the polarization vector parallel to the ClNO molecular beam axis. ClNO molecules crossing the photon beam at right angles in the scattering region are generated by effusive expansion and randomly oriented. The threshold energy for the double ionization of ClNO (30.1 \u00b1 0.1 eV) and six dissociation channels producing NO+/Cl+, N+/Cl+, N+/O+, O+/Cl+, ClN+/O+, NO+/Cl2+ ion pairs, with their relative abundance and threshold energies, have been measured.", "keywords": "ab initio calculations, Coulomb explosion, electron\u2013ion\u2013ion coincidence technique, molecular dications, potential energy surfaces, synchrotron radiation", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165197940"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/molecules28135218"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
