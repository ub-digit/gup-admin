With the intricate dependencies between operations and the digital infrastructure, lack of continuous IT transformation may hinder digital transformation, and access to capital and other resources force organizations into a situation where they need to prioritize either IT transformation or digital transformation. We refer to this dilemma with a parallel to Buridan's Ass, i.e., the paradox of a donkey destined to die of simultaneous thirst and hunger since its needs are as equal as the distance to the haystack and water trough. This study addresses an IT transformation strategy where a combination of real-time data layers, enterprise hybrid integration and low-code cloud-only environments are utilized explicitly to avoid tradeoffs with digital transformation in a government owned firm. The case is analyzed as an instantiation of Buridan's paradox, offering direct insight and a feasible solution to the dilemma of IT or digital transformation.", "keywords": "digital debt, digital transformation, government owned firms, IT transformation, technology renewal", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168240243"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
