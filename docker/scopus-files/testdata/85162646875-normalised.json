Objective: To test whether baseline values and longitudinal changes in sGFAP concentration are associated with disability progression without detectable relapse of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) inflammatory activity in participants with secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed longitudinal sGFAP concentration and clinical outcome data from the Phase 3 ASCEND trial of participants with SPMS, with no detectable relapse or MRI signs of inflammatory activity at baseline nor during the study (n = 264). Serum neurofilament (sNfL), sGFAP, T2 lesion volume, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), and composite confirmed disability progression (CDP) were measured. Linear and logistic regressions and generalized estimating equations were used in the prognostic and dynamic analyses. Results: We found a significant cross-sectional association between baseline sGFAP and sNfL concentrations and T2 lesion volume. No or weak correlations between sGFAP concentration and changes in EDSS, T25FW, and 9HPT, or CDP were observed. Conclusion: Without inflammatory activity, changes in sGFAP concentration in participants with SPMS were neither associated with current nor predictive of future disability progression.", "keywords": "biomarker, disability progression, glial fibrillary acidic protein, Multiple sclerosis, neurofilament light chain, non-inflammatory", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162646875"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/13524585231176732"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
