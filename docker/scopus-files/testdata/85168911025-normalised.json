The timing of the pubertal changes relative to same-age, same-sex peers has well-established implications for the psychosocial adjustment of adolescents. This article summarizes findings from the most influential empirical studies in the field of pubertal timing and its developmental significance for mental health and social adjustment. In addition, the article presents the major theories, models, and hypotheses in the field and attends to the questions of why, when, and under what circumstances pubertal timing is consequential. The article ends with a discussion on implications for interventions and the need for future research.", "keywords": "Biopsychosocial, Body changes, Development, Externalizing problems, Hormones, Internalizing problems, Peers, Physical development, Pubertal timing, Puberty, Reproduction, Sex, Sexual development, Social relations", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168911025"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/B978-0-323-91497-0.00058-8"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Ther\u00e9se", "first_name": "Skoog", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "26031197700"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
