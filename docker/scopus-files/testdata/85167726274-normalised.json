Despite good treatment results, a proportion of patients does not respond to treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term prognosis and the outcome of salvage therapy, after an initial treatment failure, in a nation-wide real-life setting. Method: Data from all adult patients registered in the national Swedish hepatitis C treatment register who did not achieve sustained virological response after initial antiviral treatment, was retrieved from 2014 through 2018. Results: In total, 288 patients with primary treatment failure were included, of whom 236 underwent a second treatment course as salvage therapy after a median delay of 353 (IQR: 215\u2013650) days. Fifteen patients received a third treatment course as second salvage treatment after a further median delay of 193 (IQR: 160\u2013378) days. One-hundred-eleven out of 124 (90%) non-cirrhotic and 62/79 (78%) cirrhotic patients achieved sustained virological response following the first salvage treatment. Sustained virological response was achieved by 108/112 (96%) patients who received a triple antiviral regimen. In total 69 patients were lost to follow-up or died waiting for salvage treatment. Baseline cirrhosis was associated with poor long-term survival. Conclusion: Our study indicates that salvage therapy was effective in most patients with primary treatment failure, in particular when a triple direct acting antiviral regimen was given. To avoid the risk of death or complications, patients with primary treatment failure should be offered salvage therapy with a triple regimen, as soon as possible.", "keywords": "DAA treatment, Hepatitis C, liver cirrhosis, survival, treatment failure, treatment outcome", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167726274"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/23744235.2023.2244069"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Johan", "first_name": "Westin", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-2064-073X"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7005136305"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Magdalena", "first_name": "Ydreborg", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "16314674500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60014077", "scopus-affilname": "Sk\u00e5nes Universitetssjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Christian", "first_name": "Kampmann", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57211080950"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Rune", "first_name": "Wejst\u00e5l", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7004094650"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60019295", "scopus-affilname": "Karolinska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Ola", "first_name": "Weiland", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "35478495000"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
