Despite good treatment results, a proportion of patients does not respond to treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term prognosis and the outcome of salvage therapy, after an initial treatment failure, in a nation-wide real-life setting. Method: Data from all adult patients registered in the national Swedish hepatitis C treatment register who did not achieve sustained virological response after initial antiviral treatment, was retrieved from 2014 through 2018. Results: In total, 288 patients with primary treatment failure were included, of whom 236 underwent a second treatment course as salvage therapy after a median delay of 353 (IQR: 215\u2013650) days. Fifteen patients received a third treatment course as second salvage treatment after a further median delay of 193 (IQR: 160\u2013378) days. One-hundred-eleven out of 124 (90%) non-cirrhotic and 62/79 (78%) cirrhotic patients achieved sustained virological response following the first salvage treatment. Sustained virological response was achieved by 108/112 (96%) patients who received a triple antiviral regimen. In total 69 patients were lost to follow-up or died waiting for salvage treatment. Baseline cirrhosis was associated with poor long-term survival. Conclusion: Our study indicates that salvage therapy was effective in most patients with primary treatment failure, in particular when a triple direct acting antiviral regimen was given. To avoid the risk of death or complications, patients with primary treatment failure should be offered salvage therapy with a triple regimen, as soon as possible.", "keywords": "DAA treatment, Hepatitis C, liver cirrhosis, survival, treatment failure, treatment outcome", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167726274"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/23744235.2023.2244069"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
