The aim was to investigate significant changes in health and digital habits in fourth grade and ninth grade pupils in 2020 compared to 2011. Methods: A validated questionnaire was conducted in 2011 and 2020 among schoolchildren in fourth (10 years) and ninth grade (15 years) in Sweden. The study population consisted of 196 students in 2020 and 254 students in 2011. Results: A significant increase was seen in self-reported sleeping difficulties, tiredness, life dissatisfaction and dissatisfaction with academic abilities among fourth grade children and a sixfold increase in their refusal to go to school. Students in fourth grade also reported that they spent more time on social media and had a reduced interest in sports. Both students in fourth and ninth grade described an increase in attacks of anger and unhappiness, as well as decreased time with family. Conclusion: We conclude that fourth grade children have more physical and mental health symptoms in 2020 compared to 2011. The ninth grade students showed a high frequency of physical and mental symptoms in 2011, which remained high in 2020. One possible explanation may be that digital habits have increased.", "keywords": "mental health, physical health, schoolchildren, screen time, sleep duration", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168356983"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/apa.16941"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Karin", "first_name": "Mossberg", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58542293200"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Per", "first_name": "M\u00f6llborg", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-2742-6154"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "15053518800"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
