What is unclear is whether the characteristics affecting vulnerability of small communities within countries produce similar patterns of excess mortality across countries with different demographics and public health responses to the pandemic. Our aim is to quantify community-level variations in excess mortality within England, Italy and Sweden and identify how such spatial variability was driven by community-level characteristics. METHODS: We applied a two-stage Bayesian model to quantify inequalities in excess mortality in people aged 40\u2009years and older at the community level in England, Italy and Sweden during the first year of the pandemic (March 2020-February 2021). We used community characteristics measuring deprivation, air pollution, living conditions, population density and movement of people as covariates to quantify their associations with excess mortality. RESULTS: We found just under half of communities in England (48.1%) and Italy (45.8%) had an excess mortality of over 300 per 100\u200a000 males over the age of 40, while for Sweden that covered 23.1% of communities. We showed that deprivation is a strong predictor of excess mortality across the three countries, and communities with high levels of overcrowding were associated with higher excess mortality in England and Sweden. CONCLUSION: These results highlight some international similarities in factors affecting mortality that will help policy makers target public health measures to increase resilience to the mortality impacts of this and future pandemics.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166386974"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1093/eurpub/ckad075"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
