A secondary aim was to study these associations in a subgroup of individuals with normal BMI. METHOD: This cross-sectional study included 265 individuals. The participants were categorised into three different pain groups: Chronic widespread pain (CWP), chronic regional pain (ChRP), or no chronic pain (NCP). The pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were assessed using computerised pressure algometry. Low PPTs were defined as having PPTs in the lowest third of all tender points. Leptin and metabolic factors such as BMI, visceral fat area (VFA), lipids, and glucose were also assessed. RESULT: Sixteen per cent reported CWP, 15% had low PPTs, and 4% fulfilled both criteria. Those who fulfilled the criteria for CWP were more often women, more obese, and had increased leptin levels. In logistic regression, adjusted for age and gender, leptin was associated with fulfilling criteria for CWP, OR 1.015 (95% CI 1.004-1.027, p\u2009=\u20090.008). In logistic regression, adjusted for age and gender, leptin was associated with low PPTs, OR 1.016 (95% CI 1.004-1.029, p\u2009=\u20090.012). Leptin was also associated with fulfilling both criteria, adjusted for age, sex, and visceral fat area (VFA), OR 1.030 (95% CI 1.001-1.060), p\u2009=\u20090.040. CONCLUSION: Leptin was associated with fulfilling the combined criteria for chronic widespread pain and low PPTs, even after adjusting for the visceral fat area (VFA). Longitudinal studies are needed to study the causal relationships between leptin and the development of widespread pain.
