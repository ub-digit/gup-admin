Materials and Methods: Nine healthy females (15\u201320 y of age) with four pre-molar extractions and fixed appliance were included. In total, 134 stimulated and 134 unstimulated saliva samples were collected: at baseline and then every 6\u20138 weeks at follow-up appointments during the whole orthodontic treatment. Twelve age-matched females with no active orthodontic treatment served as a control group. Saliva samples were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa). The mean levels of OPG and RANKL were calculated according to the different orthodontic treatment stages: alignment, space closure and finishing. A mixed model analysis was used to compare the means of treatment stages. Baseline OPG levels were compared with the control group using an independent t-test. OPG levels were measured in stimulated saliva due to low levels in unstimulated saliva. Results: No significant difference was observed between baseline OPG values and the control group. OPG increased significantly at all treatment stages: alignment, space closure and finishing compared with baseline (P = 0.002, P = 0.039, P \u2264 0.001, respectively). The salivary levels of OPG increased gradually, except during space closure, reaching peak levels at finishing. RANKL was undetectable in stimulated and unstimulated saliva by sandwich Elisa during OTM. Conclusions: This novel approach shows the changes in the levels of OPG in OTM and indicates how and when to sample saliva during orthodontic treatment to analyse bone remodelling.", "keywords": "bone remodelling, fixed appliance, OPG, orthodontics, RANKL, saliva, tooth movement", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164161093"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/ocr.12687"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
