Whether these two different treatment strategies are comparable in mitigating the detrimental effect of PA on outcomes is still debated. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this systematic review is to identify, appraise and synthesise existing literature comparing clinical outcomes after treatment in patients with PA. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic and comprehensive search will be performed using PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE, for studies published until December 2022. Observational and interventional studies will be eligible for inclusion. The quality of observational studies will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, while interventional studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Effective Practice Organization of Care tool. The collected evidence will be narratively synthesised. We will perform meta-analysis to pool estimates from studies considered to be homogeneous. Reporting of the systematic review and meta-analysis will be in accordance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As this study is based solely on the published literature, no ethics approval is required. This review will aim to provide some estimates on outcomes, including survival, rates of clinical and biochemical control, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, as well as data on quality of life and renal function, in patients with PA treated surgically or with MR antagonists. The study findings will be presented at scientific meetings and will be published in an international peer-reviewed scientific journal.
