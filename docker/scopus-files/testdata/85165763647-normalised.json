The dominant dissociation channel of [OCS]2+ is charge separation forming CO+ + S+ ion pairs, found here to be formed with low intensity at a lower-energy onset and with a correspondingly smaller kinetic energy release than in the more intense higher energy channel previously reported. We explain the formation of CO+ + S+ ion pairs at low as well as higher ionization energies by the existence of two predissociation channels, one involving a newly identified COS2+ metastable state. We conclude that the dominant CO+ + S+ channel with 5.2 eV kinetic energy release is reached upon OCS2+ \u2192 COS2+ isomerization, whereas the smaller kinetic energy release (of \u223c4 eV) results from the direct fragmentation of OCS2+ (X3\u03a3\u2212) ions. Dissociation of the COS2+ isomer also explains the existence of the minor C+ + SO+ ion pair channel. We suggest that isomerization prior to dissociation may be a widespread mechanism in dications and more generally in multiply charged ion dissociations.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165763647"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1039/d3cp01688a"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
