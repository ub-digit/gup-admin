DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed, Prospero CRD42022345640. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, All EBM, CINAHL, and PsycINFO was searched on July, 8, 2022, for studies including women with PCOS, comparing 2 different COCPs in randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: A total of 1660 studies were identified, and 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included.Fourth-generation COCP resulted in lower body mass index (BMI) (mean difference [MD] 1.17\u2005kg/m2 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.33; 2.02]) and testosterone (MD 0.60\u2005nmol/L [95% CI 0.13; 1.07]) compared with third-generation agents, but no difference was seen in hirsutism.Ethinyl estradiol (EE)/cyproterone acetate (CPA) was better in reducing hirsutism as well as biochemical hyperandrogenism (testosterone [MD 0.38\u2005nmol/L {95% CI 0.33-0.43}]) and BMI (MD 0.62\u2005kg/m2 [95% CI 0.05-1.20]) compared with conventional COCPs.There was no difference in hirsutism between high and low EE doses. No evidence regarding natural estrogens in COCP was identified. CONCLUSION: With current evidence, combined regimens containing an antiandrogen (EE/CPA) may be better compared with conventional COCPs in reducing hyperandrogenism, but EE/CPA will not be recommended as a first-line COCP treatment by the pending PCOS guideline update, due to higher venous thrombotic events (VTE) risk in the general population. Later-generation progestins offer theoretical benefits, but better evidence on clinical outcomes is needed in women with PCOS.
