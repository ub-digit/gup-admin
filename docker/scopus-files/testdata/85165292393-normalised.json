Research indicates that teachers have concerns regarding the use of digital media in preschool, especially in relation to play. In this study, we explore how an early childhood education and care (ECEC) work team takes on this challenge when, in focus group conversations, discusses digital media in relation to a theoretical framework with principles and implications for understanding play and teaching in preschool. We adopt a sociocultural perspective when examining the mediating role of theoretical concepts for reasoning about the integration of digital media in ECEC. The findings illustrate how the concepts mediate an understanding of (i) play and teaching as responsive activities with a focus on the importance of sharing the same digital media references (ii) play and teaching activities as building on a mutual frame of reference, which is a challenge as children have different experiences of digital media than adults, (iii) play as including fluctuations between \u201cas if\u201d and \u201cas is\u201d and something that must include fantasy and an openness, with digital media contributing to or hindering such openness, and (iv) how teaching can take shape in mutual activities where mutual experiences of digital media can be used as a starting point for teaching. Implications for professional development efforts and teacher agency are discussed.", "keywords": "digital play/digital media, early childhood teachers, mediation, Play-Responsive Early Childhood Education and Care, teacher agency", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165292393"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/1476718X231179084"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
