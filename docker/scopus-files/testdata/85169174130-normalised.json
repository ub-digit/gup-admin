METHODS: In a community-based study, we examined 2816 middle-aged participants with focus on cardiometabolic risk factors in 2002-2005. A representative sample of 1954 men and women was invited to follow-up in 2012-2014 and 1327 were included in a second study visit. Mean follow-up time was 9.7\u200ayears. Blood pressure was measured according to the guidelines from the seventh Joint National Committee of Hypertension, and new cases of hypertension were recorded. SHBG was measured at baseline. The association between SHBG, blood pressure and new cases of hypertension was investigated using linear regression analyses and logistic regression analyses after excluding individuals treated with blood pressure-lowering drugs. RESULTS: Mean SBP and DBP at follow-up was 123 and 72\u200ammHg, respectively, and mean increase from baseline was 5.8 and 2.9\u200ammHg. During the follow-up time, 167 new cases of hypertension (16.1%) were identified. One standard deviation (SD) increase in SHBG at baseline was inversely associated with the risk to develop hypertension at follow-up (OR\u200a=\u200a0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.95) in the fully adjusted model. Moreover, one SD increase in SHBG was associated with a decrease in mean SBP (delta\u200a=\u200a-1.5\u200ammHg, 95% CI - 2.2 to -0.8) and DBP (delta\u200a=\u200a- 1.0\u200ammHg, 95% CI - 1.5 to -0.4), after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSION: SHBG levels are inversely associated with development of hypertension and change in blood pressure levels independent of major risk factors.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169174130"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1097/HJH.0000000000003506"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "130124839", "scopus-affilname": "Institute for Medicine", "scopus-affiliation-city": null, "scopus-affiliation-country": null}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Michel E.S.", "first_name": "Watz", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58555979000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60046006", "scopus-affilname": "Wallenberglaboratoriet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "\u00c5sa", "first_name": "Tivesten", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6601915219"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "130124839", "scopus-affilname": "Institute for Medicine", "scopus-affiliation-city": null, "scopus-affiliation-country": null}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Kristin", "first_name": "Ottarsdottir", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57208556306"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Ying", "first_name": "Li", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58555979100"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "130124839", "scopus-affilname": "Institute for Medicine", "scopus-affiliation-city": null, "scopus-affiliation-country": null}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Margareta I.", "first_name": "Hellgren", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "14422380600"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "130124839", "scopus-affilname": "Institute for Medicine", "scopus-affiliation-city": null, "scopus-affiliation-country": null}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Ulf", "first_name": "Lindblad", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "35397665700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "130124839", "scopus-affilname": "Institute for Medicine", "scopus-affiliation-city": null, "scopus-affiliation-country": null}], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "Bledar", "first_name": "Daka", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "40261206300"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
