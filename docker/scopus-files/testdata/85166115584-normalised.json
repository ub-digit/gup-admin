Since 2008, the Swedish government has acted on this by funding national graduate schools to enable teachers and teacher educators to undertake educational research leading to an academic degree. In this chapter, we describe and discuss two such schools in language education. One brought ten lower and upper secondary teachers to a licentiate degree; the other is bringing nine language teacher educators to a PhD. The design of both programmes entailed collaboration at various levels, between Swedish universities - four in the first programme, three in the second - and between the participants in the research schools and national and international colleagues attached to the programmes as readers and discussants. A characteristic aspect of the two graduate schools that the chapter pays special attention to, highlighting benefits for the parties involved, is the reciprocity embedded in the pedagogical model used, which encompasses graduate students, researchers, schools, teachers and pupils, universities, and educational authorities.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166115584"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1515/9783110787719-013"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
