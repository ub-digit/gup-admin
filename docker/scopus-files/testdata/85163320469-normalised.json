This is done using Okounkov bodies \u0394 (L), and the image of D under the standard moment map will approximate \u0394 (L). This means that the volume of D can be made to approximate the K\u00e4hler volume of X arbitrarily well. As a special case we can let D be an ellipsoid. We also have similar results when L is just big.", "keywords": "Kahler currents, Okounkov bodies", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163320469"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/978-3-031-17859-7_31"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
