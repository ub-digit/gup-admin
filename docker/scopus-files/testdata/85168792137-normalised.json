This study aimed to explore the influence of bone conduction hearing aid (BCHA) implantation on HRQoL and hearing disability in patients with hearing loss suffering from tinnitus. (2) Methods: Data were collected from an international hearing implant registry. Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI-3), Spatial and Qualities of Hearing- 49 Questionnaire (SSQ) and self-reported tinnitus burden data for adult patients implanted with a BCHA (n = 42) who provided baseline as well as follow-up data 1-year post-implantation were extracted from the registry. Wilcoxon signed rank tests and paired samples t-tests were used to analyse outcomes data. (3) Results: Patients, with or without tinnitus, demonstrated clinically important mean improvements in HUI-3 multi-attribute utility scores, HUI-3 hearing attribute and SSQ scores. Hearing loss patients with tinnitus presented with a lower HRQoL than patients without tinnitus. (4) Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the importance of hearing rehabilitation in improving the quality of life and hearing disability of patients with or without tinnitus and in providing tinnitus relief in some patients with hearing loss and tinnitus.", "keywords": "bone conduction implant, hearing loss, hearing rehabilitation, quality of life, tinnitus, utility gain", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168792137"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/audiolres13040050"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Nasrene", "first_name": "Khan", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-6720-8971"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58549565700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "128243704", "scopus-affilname": "Cochlear Limited", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Molnlycke", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Aaran T.", "first_name": "Lewis", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57189591266"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
