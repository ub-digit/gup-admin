The aim of this review is to examine the literature on GD patient needs, expectations, perceptions, and quality of life. We will also present methods for patient care, define gaps in knowledge, and suggest factors that can be introduced into the regular care of GD patients. Patient information, teamwork with thyroid/contact nurses, education of personnel and patients, quality of life measurements, and the formation of a rehabilitation program have enough evidence to be implemented into regular care. However, visualizing patient needs through person-centered care requires further evaluation in GD patients before being implemented in routine care. We conclude that considerable improvement in nursing can be achieved in relation to GD.", "keywords": "contact nurse, Graves' disease, mental fatigue, patient experience, patient needs, person-centered care, quality of life", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164387764"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1530/ETJ-23-0010"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
