Phagosome maturation is associated with significant changes in the proteome of phagosomes due to the acquisition of new proteins or enzymes, post-translational modifications of existing proteins, as well as other biochemical changes that ultimately lead to the degradation or processing of the phagocytosed particle. Phagosomes are highly dynamic organelles formed by the uptake of particles through phagocytic innate immune cells; thus characterization of the phagosomal proteome is essential to understand the mechanisms controlling innate immunity, as well as vesicle trafficking. In this chapter, we describe how novel quantitative proteomics methods, such as using tandem mass tag (TMT) labelling or acquiring label-free data using data-independent acquisition (DIA), can be applied for the characterization of protein composition of phagosomes in macrophages.", "keywords": "Data-dependent acquisition (DDA), Data-independent acquisition (DIA), Macrophages, Mass spectrometry\u00a0(MS), Phagosomes, Quantitative proteomics, Tandem mass tag (TMT)", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163322664"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/978-1-0716-3338-0_23"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
