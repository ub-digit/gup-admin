Aim: To compare the molecular events in the overlying soft tissue, the membrane, and the underlying bone defect during GBR using dual-layered expanded membranes versus dense polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membranes. Materials and Methods: Rat femur defects were treated with either dense PTFE (d-PTFE) or dual-layered expanded PTFE (dual e-PTFE) or left untreated as a sham. Samples were collected after 6 and 28 days for gene expression, histology, and histomorphometry analyses. Results: The two membranes promoted the overall bone formation compared to sham. Defects treated with dual e-PTFE exhibited a significantly higher proportion of new bone in the top central region after 28 days. Compared to that in the sham, the soft tissue in the dual e-PTFE group showed 2-fold higher expression of genes related to regeneration (FGF-2 and FOXO1) and vascularization (VEGF). Furthermore, compared to cells in the d-PTFE group, cells in the dual e-PTFE showed 2.5-fold higher expression of genes related to osteogenic differentiation (BMP-2), regeneration (FGF-2 and COL1A1), and vascularization (VEGF), in parallel with lower expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1). Multiple correlations were found between the molecular activities in membrane-adherent cells and those in the soft tissue. Conclusion: Selective surface modification of the two sides of the e-PTFE membrane constitutes a novel means of modulating the tissue response and promoting bone regeneration.", "keywords": "bone regeneration, cytokines, gene expression, growth factors, PTFE, soft tissue regeneration", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162870895"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/cid.13241"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
