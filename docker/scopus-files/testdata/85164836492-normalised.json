EVs use a lot of data for battery management and delivering optimum performance, and the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role in managing this data. This study develops a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model for designing a sustainable circular supply chain to manage the manufacturing, remanufacturing, and distribution of EV lithium-ion batteries under uncertainty using the IoT and big data. The proposed model simultaneously minimizes total costs and CO2 emissions and uses IoT to improve network performance and create a traceable and secure environment. A fuzzy multi-objective method solves the bi-objective optimization model under uncertainty, and a simulation algorithm examines the effectiveness of the proposed model through simulated problems.", "keywords": "big data, electric vehicle, internet of things, lithium-ion battery, sustainable circular supply chain, uncertainty", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164836492"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/exsy.13395"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
