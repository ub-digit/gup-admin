I argue that selection via primaries, which has become popular in Western Europe, is an important cue to voters. Drawing on procedural fairness theory, I develop contradicting arguments about how primaries affect voters\u2019 evaluations of candidate quality, such that either the logic of procedural fairness improves voters\u2019 evaluations of candidates\u2019 quality, or the violation thereof through clientelism and vote-buying leads to worse evaluations of candidates. I employ a conjoint experiment, implemented in Spain, and analyze responses to an open-ended question to investigate underlying mechanisms. The findings indicate that voters perceive candidates resulting out of primaries as outsiders, who are less corrupt but also less experienced and less competent.", "keywords": "candidate selection, corruptibility, primaries, Spain, valence", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163393164"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/13540688231184627"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
