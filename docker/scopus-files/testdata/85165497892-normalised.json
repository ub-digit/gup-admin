Several statements were presented among five experts in three rounds of the Delphi technique; thereafter, the statement was presented as a questionnaire among 128 professionals and practitioners in disaster medicine through a quantitative survey. The results revealed that a high percentage of participants urged the necessity for several changes in the current Saudi curriculum of disaster and emergency medicine. According to the participants that the current curriculum does not cover essential knowledge in Command and Control, Safety, Communication, Assessment, and the roles of each individual and agency, needs to be enhanced by including several other aspects of disaster and emergency management, such as all risk management, internal and external communication, coordination, cooperation\u00a0and collaboration in transport issues, teaching and training, and promoting multiagency collaboration and enable extracurricular activities. This study recommends continuous revision, and development of the current curriculum in Saudi Arabia and integration of the collaborative tools as well as the inclusion of disaster simulation using the same collaborative strategy.
