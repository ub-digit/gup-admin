The use of digital artefacts is increasing in various workplaces, to include professionals in healthcare. This paper aims to explore the following research question: How is the professional learning unfolding in patient-based work when a digital artefact transforms the practice? Design/methodology/approach: Various data collection methods are used for this study, consisting of dialogue meetings, interviews and a reference-group meeting. Thematic analysis is used to inductively bring forth the themes of the collected data. Findings: Professionals\u2019 knowledge and experience are of vital importance in learning and changing work practices. Together with their ability to reflect on changes, their knowledge and experience constitute the prefiguration when the introduction of a digital application brings about indeterminacy in the work practice. Originality/value: This paper makes a contribution to practice-based research as it consolidates previous research and identifies professionals knowledge and learning in a healthcare context. This can be used to further explore and advance the field, as well as to establish the evidence-based importance of transforming practices based on implementation of digital artefacts.", "keywords": "Cognitive impairment, Digital artefact, Healthcare professionals, Learning, Practice research, Sociomateriality", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165343709"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1108/JWL-01-2023-0011"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
