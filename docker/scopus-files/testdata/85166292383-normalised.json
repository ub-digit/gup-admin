The American Heart Association guidelines suggest the use of exercise ECG in patients with stable chest pain and low pre-test probability (PTP) of significant coronary artery disease, while the European Society of Cardiology Guidelines does not. This retrospective observational study aimed to assess the usefulness of exercise ECG in the low-PTP population with stable chest pain. We reviewed the medical records for all outpatient exercise ECGs conducted because of stable chest pain at the Department of Medicine and Emergency, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, M\u00f6lndal, Sweden, during 2016\u20132018. The identified patients were categorized in low-, intermediate-, or high-risk pre-test probability of significant coronary artery disease. All low-PTP patients were followed for one year post investigation for the incidence of acute coronary syndrome and all-cause mortality. Thus, 505 patients (mean age 60 years, 56% women) with low PTP were included in the study. Only four patients (0.6%) experienced incident myocardial infarction (three patients) or all-cause mortality (one patient). The negative predictive value of exercise ECG was 99.7%, and the positive predictive value was 28.6%. In this low-PTP population, exercise ECG yields a good negative predictive value and a poor positive predictive value.", "keywords": "angina pectoris, coronary artery disease, exercise ECG, pre-test probability, stable chest pain", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166292383"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/jcm12144670"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
