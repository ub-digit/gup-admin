A recent maternal genome-wide association study of spontaneous PTB identified a noncoding locus near the angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2) gene. Genotype-Tissue Expression data revealed that alleles associated with decreased AGTR2 expression in the uterus were linked to an increased risk of PTB and shortened gestational duration. We hypothesized that a causative variant in this locus modifies AGTR2 expression by altering transcription factor (TF) binding. METHODS: To investigate this hypothesis, we performed bioinformatics analyses and functional characterizations at the implicated locus. Potential causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were prioritized, and allele-dependent binding of TFs was predicted. Reporter assays were employed to assess the enhancer activity of the top PTB-associated non-coding variant, rs7889204, and its impact on TF binding. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed that rs7889204, a top PTB-associated non-coding genetic variant is one of the strongest eQTLs for the AGTR2 gene in uterine tissue samples. We observed differential binding of CEBPB (CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta) and HOXA10 (homeobox A10) to the alleles of rs7889204. Reporter assays demonstrated decreased enhancer activity for the rs7889204 risk \"C\" allele. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results demonstrate that decreased AGTR2 expression caused by reduced transcription factor binding increases the risk for PTB and suggest that enhancing AGTR2 activity may be a preventative measure in reducing PTB risk.", "keywords": "AGTR2, Functional studies, Non-coding variant, Preterm birth", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164861567"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s12916-023-02973-w"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
