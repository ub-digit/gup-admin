In this review we summarize data from the last 15 years indicating that osteoblast-lineage cells are regulators of whole-body energy metabolism and fat mass. We focus mainly on three factors, osteocalcin, lipocalin-2 and sclerostin, that are released by osteoblast-lineage cells and proposed to exert endocrine effects on metabolism. In addition, we present a hypothesis on why osteoblast-lineage cells during evolution have developed a function to regulate metabolism and fat mass. We propose that osteoblast-lineage cells through the osteocyte network in bone are sensors of gravitational forces induced by body mass and gravity on land-living species. By sensing the body weight, the osteoblastlineage cells may then feed-back this information on the whole-body nutritional status via osteoblast-derived endocrine factors or via the nervous system to regulate energy metabolism and fat mass.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166907038"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.coemr.2023.100470"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
