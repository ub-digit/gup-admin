There is an association between the intensity of abdominal pain and the need for health care utilization. A bidirectionally disordered gut-brain interaction is central in the pathophysiology of IBS where a number of factors, gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal, can contribute to the illness experience. In order to treat abdominal pain in IBS, mapping these factors in a multidimensional clinical profile is helpful. Areas covered: This review covers basic epidemiology and pathophysiology of abdominal pain in IBS, the diagnostic approach, and a multidimensional treatment model where the management of abdominal pain is in focus. Expert opinion: A personalized treatment of abdominal pain in IBS is possible in patients who understand the diagnosis, the potential of therapies used, and where a good continuity in the patient-doctor relationship is established.", "keywords": "abdominal pain, diagnosis, disorders of gut-brain interaction, epidemiology, Irritable bowel syndrome, pathophysiology, treatment", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166970884"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/17474124.2023.2242775"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
