Methods: Patients newly diagnosed with AL amyloidosis were identified using six linked Swedish nationwide population-based registers. For each case, individuals from the general population were selected and matched with a maximum ratio of 1:5 based on age, sex, calendar year, and county. Results: 846 patients newly diagnosed with AL amyloidosis and 4227 demographically matched individuals were identified. From 2011 to 2019, annual AL amyloidosis incidence increased from 10.5 to 15.1 cases per million. At baseline, patients with AL amyloidosis had a significantly higher disease burden including higher rates of cardiac and renal failure relative to the comparison group. Among patients with AL amyloidosis, 21.5% had incident heart failure and 17.1% had incident renal failure after initial diagnosis. Median OS for patients with AL amyloidosis was 56 months versus not reached in the matched general population comparison group. Conclusion: The incidence of newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis in Sweden increased over time with AL amyloidosis being associated with a higher risk of cardiac/renal failure and all-cause mortality compared with the general population.", "keywords": "AL amyloidosis, disease burden, population-based, Swedish registers", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166675583"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/ejh.14063"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
