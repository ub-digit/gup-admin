This review does not intend to solve the debate, rather it soothes it by contributing to the concept of \u201cwhen it pays to be green.\u201d By focusing on the shortcomings of existing literature reviews on the topic of corporate sustainability and financial performance (CSFP) in this hybrid review, issues were identified that had been overlooked earlier. In general, CSFP holds a positive relationship but in a time lag. Nonconclusive results about the relationship within CSFP are due to self-selection bias, endogeneity issues, and the use of multiple datasets and industry categories. Surprisingly, we also discovered that the impact of sustainability on financial performance is elusive in capitalist countries considered to be economically rational. Institutional and legitimacy requirements are a good starting point for shaping corporate behaviors in the short term; however, they might not be equally appropriate in the long term in cases when corporations shift operations to pollution havens. A multifaceted, synergistic interaction between governmental institutions, corporations, and other stakeholders is required\u2014without imposing authority\u2014to ensure durable sustainable development.", "keywords": "bibliometric analysis, corporate performance, corporate responsibility, CSR, ESG, financial performance, literature review, stakeholder engagement, sustainability, sustainable development", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169055193"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1002/csr.2600"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031052", "scopus-affilname": "Hogskolan i Gavle", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gavle", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60022085", "scopus-affilname": "H\u00f6gskolan i Halmstad", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Halmstad", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "ABM Fazle", "first_name": "Rahi", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-0386-6574"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57223352141"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60022085", "scopus-affilname": "H\u00f6gskolan i Halmstad", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Halmstad", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60007183", "scopus-affilname": "Lule\u00e5 University of Technology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lulea", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Jeaneth", "first_name": "Johansson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56007455500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Marita", "first_name": "Blomkvist", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "37090347000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031052", "scopus-affilname": "Hogskolan i Gavle", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gavle", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Fredrik", "first_name": "Hartwig", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55485089700"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
