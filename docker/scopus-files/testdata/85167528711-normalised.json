Nevertheless, the provision of information to meet individuals needs from their level of health literacy is often overlooked. Thus, individuals information needs are often unmet, leading to reports of discontent. Internet and digital information technology has significantly augmented the available information and changed the way in which persons accesses and comprehends information. As health information is no longer explicitly obtained from healthcare professionals, it is essential to examine the sequences of the health information process in general, and in relation to health literacy. This paper reports on qualitative interviews, targeting women diagnosed with breast cancer who were given access to a health information technology tool, Digi-Do, before commencing radiation therapy, during, and after treatment. METHODS: A qualitative research design, inspired by the integrated health literacy model, was chosen to enable critical reflection by the participating women. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 women with access to a digital information tool, named Digi-Do, in addition to receiving standard information (oral and written) before commencing radiation therapy, during, and after treatment. A deductive thematic analysis process was conducted. RESULTS: The results demonstrate how knowledge, competence, and motivation influence women's experience of the health information process. Three main themes were found: Meeting interactive and personal needs by engaging with health information; Critical recognition of sources of information; and Capability to communicate comprehended health information. The findings reflect the women's experience of the four competencies: to access, understand, appraise, and apply, essential elements of the health information process. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that there is a need for tailored digital information tools, such as the Digi-Do, to enable iterative access and use of reliable health information before, during and after the radiation therapy process. The Digi-Do can be seen as a valuable complement to the interpersonal communication with health care professionals, facilitating a better understanding, and enabling iterative access and use of reliable health information before, during and after the radiotherapy treatment. This enhances a sense of preparedness before treatment starts.", "keywords": "Breast cancer, Digital information tool, Health information process, Radiation therapy", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167528711"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s12913-023-09837-2"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60002369", "scopus-affilname": "School of Health and Welfare", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Jonkoping", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60002369", "scopus-affilname": "School of Health and Welfare", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Jonkoping", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60002369", "scopus-affilname": "School of Health and Welfare", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Jonkoping", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Annika", "first_name": "Grynne", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57221701745"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60012311", "scopus-affilname": "Karolinska Institutet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Josefin", "first_name": "W\u00e5ngdahl", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56016568800"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60118581", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r H\u00e4lsovetenskaper", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60002369", "scopus-affilname": "School of Health and Welfare", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Jonkoping", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60002369", "scopus-affilname": "School of Health and Welfare", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Jonkoping", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Sofi", "first_name": "Fristedt", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55084313400"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60000990", "scopus-affilname": "Chalmers University of Technology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "114734888", "scopus-affilname": "Regional Cancer Centre West", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Frida", "first_name": "Smith", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55346672700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60002369", "scopus-affilname": "School of Health and Welfare", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Jonkoping", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60002369", "scopus-affilname": "School of Health and Welfare", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Jonkoping", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Maria", "first_name": "Browall", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "13102729200"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
