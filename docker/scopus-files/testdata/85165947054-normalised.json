Therefore, it is crucial to develop efficient and cost-effective methods for degrading furfural in the environment. Currently, the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for furfural degradation in water has shown effectiveness, but there is a need to explore improved efficiency and tolerance in S. cerevisiae for this purpose. In this study, we isolated and evolved highly efficient furfural degradation strains, namely YBA_08 and F60C. These strains exhibited remarkable capabilities, degrading 59% and 99% furfural in the YPD medium after 72 h of incubation, significantly higher than the 31% achieved by the model strain S288C. Through analysis of the efficient degradation mechanism in the evolutionary strain F60C, we discovered a 326% increase in the total amount of NADH and NADPH. This increase likely promotes faster furfural degradation through intracellular aldehyde reductases. Moreover, the decrease in NADPH content led to a 406% increase in glutathione content at the background level, which protects cells from damage caused by reactive oxygen species. Mutations and differential expression related to cell cycle and cell wall synthesis were observed, enabling cell survival in the presence of furfural and facilitating rapid furfural degradation and growth recovery. Based on these findings, it is speculated that strains YBA_08 and F60C have the potential to contribute to furfural degradation in water and the production of furfuryl alcohol, ethanol, and FDCA in biorefinery processes.", "keywords": "Adaptive laboratory evolution, Degradation, Environmental protection, Furfural, Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165947054"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132090"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
