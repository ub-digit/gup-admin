Consistent with observations in humans, FXS model mice display distinct RRBs and hyperactivity that are consistent with dysfunctional cortico-striatal circuits, an area relatively unexplored in FXS. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we dissect the contribution of two populations of striatal medium spiny neurons (SPNs) in the expression of RRBs in FXS model mice. Here, we report that dysregulated protein synthesis at cortico-striatal synapses is a molecular culprit of the synaptic and ASD-associated motor phenotypes displayed by FXS model mice. Cell-type-specific translational profiling of the FXS mouse striatum reveals differentially translated mRNAs, providing critical information concerning potential therapeutic targets. Our findings uncover a cell-type-specific impact of the loss of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) on translation and the sequence of neuronal events in the striatum that drive RRBs in FXS.", "keywords": "CP: Neuroscience, FMRP, fragile X syndrome, LTD, protein synthesis, repetitive behaviors, RGS4, striatum, TRAP", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165934372"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112901"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
