Methods: The cohort comprised 762 elite athletes (54% males; age 26.5 \u00b1 5.9\u00a0years) in 38 sports in the Swedish Olympic Committee support program \u2018Top and Talent\u2019 between 1999 and 2020, with total 3427 athlete-years included. Acute and gradual onset injuries were reported to the insurance registry by the athletes\u2019 medical staff. Results: A total of 1635 injuries in 468 athletes were registered. The overall injury incidence was 47.7 injuries/100 athlete-years (one injury per athlete every second year). An increasing trend in injury incidence was observed in the first decade 2001 to 2010 (annual change 6.0%, 95% CI 3.3\u20138.8%), while in the second decade 2011 to 2020 no change was evident (0.4%, 95% CI \u2212 1.9 to 2.7%). Gymnastics, tennis, and athletics had the highest incidence (100.0, 99.3, and 93.4 injuries/100 athlete-years, respectively). Among sport categories, mixed and power sports had the highest incidence (72.8 and 69.5 injuries/100 athlete-years, respectively). Higher incidences were seen in the younger age groups (\u2264 25\u00a0years) in mixed and skill sports. The injury incidence was comparable between male and female athletes, and summer and winter sports. Most injuries occurred in the lower limb, and specifically the knee (24%), foot/ankle (15%) and spine/pelvis (13%). Conclusion: The results on injury patterns in different sports and age groups may guide preventive focus for health and performance teams working with Olympic athletes.
