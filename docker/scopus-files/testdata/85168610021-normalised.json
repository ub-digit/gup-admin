Materials and methods: Several sodium hypochlorite solutions (NaOCl)\u2014Perisolv\u00ae, Carisolv\u00ae and Dakin\u2019s solution\u2014were equated with chlorhexidine (CHX) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) against ten oral micro-organisms related to caries and periodontitis using different minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) techniques. Agents were adjusted to the final 70 mmol/L concentration of active chlorine molecule. Results: Apart from H2O2 and the amino acids of Perisolv\u00ae, all the agents revealed an antimicrobial effect. Agar diffusion test ranked CHX (p < 0.05) as the most effective against all ten specimens, followed by the NaOCl of Perisolv\u00ae and Dakin\u2019s solution. Correspondingly, in broth microdilution on agar, CHX was the most effective in eradicating micro-organisms at 0.03 mmol/L compared with 2.2 mmol/L of Dakin\u2019s solution. In contrast, the bactericidal concentration of Dakin\u2019s solution was the most effective at 0.2 mmol/L, (p < 0.001), followed by Perisolv\u00ae (2.14 mmol/L), CHX (2.38 mmol/L) and Carisolv\u00ae (3.33 mmol/L) after 5 and 10 min in broth dilution test. In live/dead analysis, 60-min exposure to a 2-fold concentration of agents resulted in two-log Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans inhibition by CHX (35 mmol/L) whilst Streptococcus mutans was more susceptible, in 0.8 and 8.8 mmol/L, after 10 min to CHX and Dakin\u2019s respectively. Conclusion: Replacement of CHX with tested hypochlorite agents showed evident potential and promoted rapid antimicrobial effect. Clinical relevance: Effective antimicrobial agents are crucial in controlling pathogen-induced oral infections increasing clinical possibilities to combat oral biofilms. Additionally, CHX substitution with hypochlorite agents could eliminate CHX\u2019s adverse effects.", "keywords": "Chlorhexidine, Chlorine compounds, Dakin\u2019s, Dental caries, Oral disease, Periodontitis", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168610021"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s00784-023-05190-0"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Ulrica Scherdin", "first_name": "Almh\u00f6jd", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56664416200"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Anna", "first_name": "Lehrkinder", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57218709847"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60063782", "scopus-affilname": "Malmo University Faculty of Odontology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Malmo", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Ann Marie", "first_name": "Roos-Jans\u00e5ker", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6507626973"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Peter", "first_name": "Lingstr\u00f6m", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55947511100"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
