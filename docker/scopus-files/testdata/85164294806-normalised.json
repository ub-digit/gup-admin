This local constitution is described by local fibre volume content, local fibre orientation distribution and local fibre length distribution. For short fibre reinforced plastics, both distributions are affected by flow conditions during an injection moulding process. Current material models for predicting the homogenised material response account for the local volume fraction and local fibre orientation distribution. Fibre length distribution, however, is usually approximated with a single average fibre length. To investigate the effects of fibre length distribution on the elasto-plastic response of short fibre composites, a micromechanical Orientation Averaging model has been extended. Two methods are presented in this work. In the first method, an additional averaging scheme over the fibre length distribution is included. In the second method, a novel representative fibre length is presented based on a stiffness-weighted average. The predictionsobtained from these methods are then compared and evaluated against experimental results of uniaxial tensile tests taken from literature. Good agreements are found using both methods. However, for the investigated behaviour, using a representative fibre length is still beneficial due to the superior computational performance.", "keywords": "Elasto-plastic behaviour, Fibre length distribution, Micromechanics, Short fibre reinforced composites", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164294806"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.compositesb.2023.110868"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
