Radiographs demonstrated a 13\u00b0 anterior tibial slope and 15\u00b0 valgus malalignment. She underwent a single-stage 2-level osteotomy at the distal femur and proximal tibia to simultaneously correct genu valgum and recurvatum. This procedure achieved precise correction in both planes. At 1 year, the patient was pain-free and ambulated without restriction. CONCLUSION: This procedure should be considered among the available surgical options when treating genu valgum recurvatum because it produced excellent results for the studied patient.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162743506"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
