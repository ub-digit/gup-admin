To counter this involvement, academics need to be made aware of how their services might support the trade. A suitable venue for future generations of professionals to obtain this knowledge is their university education. Hence, it is of interest to ask what is taught in university programs in relevant disciplines about the illicit antiquities trade and the forms of academic entanglement within it. This article focuses on course literature in university programs for conservators. It looks at both the official curriculum (explicit and intended teaching) and the hidden curriculum (implicit and unintended teaching) concerning illicit antiquities trade and conservators' responsibilities vis-\u00e0-vis this trade. It finds that the coverage is limited and partly outdated. Further, textbooks might signal that it is acceptable to undertake the treatment of unprovenanced archaeological objects. The study suggests that it is relevant to ask not only if, but also how, the topic of professional responsibility is taught, and it argues that higher education, apart from teaching how to keep clear of activities that promote the trade, should provide the knowledge and skills to actively oppose it.", "keywords": "academic involvement, decolonizing museums and curricula, hidden curriculum, higher education for conservators, Illicit antiquities trade", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166030400"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1017/S0940739123000073"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Staffan", "first_name": "Lund\u00e9n", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-6411-1648"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57207974244"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
