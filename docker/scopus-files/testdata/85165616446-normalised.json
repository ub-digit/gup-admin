The viral infection hampers foetal brain development and causes microcephaly. Human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) play an important role in brain development, however they are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection. In this study, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms that lead to cellular alterations in hNPCs due to ZIKV E-protein. We investigated proliferation, differentiation, migration and inflammation in hNPCs, which may lead to microcephaly. In our study, we found that ZIKV E-protein causes cell cycle arrest, decrease in proliferation and increase in mitotic length of the dividing hNPCs. We observed CyclinD1 and upstream molecules (p21 and p53) of the pathway are dysregulated, and intracellular calcium at basal level as well as upon ATP stimulation were reduced following over expression of ZIKV E-protein. ZIKV E-protein transfected hNPCs exhibited pre-mature differentiation with pro-neural genes upregulated. Furthermore, ZIKV E-protein disrupted migrational properties of hNPCs and caused elevated levels of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. To gain insights into molecular mechanisms of these effects on hNPCs, we explored the possible involvement of long non coding RNAs in ZIKV neuropathogenesis. We have shortlisted lncRNAs associated with differentially expressed genes from publicly available transcriptomic data and found some of those lncRNAs are differentially expressed upon E-protein transfection of hNPCs. Gene ontology analysis suggest these lncRNAs play an important role in regulation of viral life cycle, host's defence response and cell proliferation.", "keywords": "Human neural progenitor cells, lncRNA, Microcephaly, Zika virus", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165616446"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.expneurol.2023.114493"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
