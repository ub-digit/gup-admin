Maternal immunization recommendations followed the recognition of the consequences of infectious diseases in pregnancy, including vertical transmission and perinatal consequences. The recent COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the issue of vaccination among pregnant individuals. Recommendations vary globally; however, Tdap, influenza, and, recently, COVID-19 vaccines are routinely recommended during pregnancy. There are several new maternal immunization products in the pipeline, including those directed against malaria, cytomegalovirus, Group B Streptococcus, herpes simplex virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Important challenges must be addressed in all countries to guarantee that pregnant individuals and their babies receive the best care possible, including uptake of recommended immunizations by their entire target population groups. These challenges include disseminating appropriate data for vaccine recommendations and many others, such as ensuring stakeholder endorsement, achieving in-country distribution and administration, adequate vaccine supply, and a well-organized healthcare system, ideally offering the immunization free of charge. More recently, the hesitancy of pregnant women to receive immunizations highlights the relevance of cultural aspects and other contextual factors affecting vaccine uptake among pregnant individuals.", "keywords": "immunization, misinformation, pregnancy, vaccination, vaccines", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164793457"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1002/ijgo.14981"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
