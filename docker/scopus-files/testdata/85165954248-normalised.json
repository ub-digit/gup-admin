In recent years, the arrival of emerging technologies has disrupted the value-adding activity in firms across different sectors due to the need to develop and industrialize the new technology. These alter not only the productization process but also the whole end-to-end development structures. Service design is identified as one of the areas with the potential to address these challenges. However, there is still a lack of awareness of the said topic in different industries. In this publication, the overview of emerging technologies and product development challenges are written, with the perspectives of service design. The authors provide a summary of the emerging technologies and service design, and the correlation between the two items to output a good emerging technologies-related product while facilitating feasible and scalable profitability for the companies. The aim is to bridge the knowledge gap between cross-disciplinary practitioners in different fields about the importance of service design for emerging technologies and product development. The authors believe the work will provide a good overview of the topic for cross-disciplinary book readers.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165954248"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/978-3-031-29306-1_2"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60254874", "scopus-affilname": "Handelsh\u00f6gskolan", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "126547698", "scopus-affilname": "CEVT", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Umar Zakir Abdul", "first_name": "Hamid", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58508614700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60013456", "scopus-affilname": "Arkitektur- og designh\u00f8gskolen i Oslo", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Oslo", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Mari", "first_name": "Suoheimo", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-6847-0314"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57205426960"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
