Seventy-three video documentations of reading sessions with 27 toddlers (1\u20133 years of age) over the course of three semesters were analyzed with a focus on number-oriented actions that, theoretically, would facilitate toddlers\u2019 learning of numbers. In the reading sessions the teachers extended the content of the pictures and the narrative in different ways, and how one and the same picture was handled was shown to impact on what was made possible for the children to discern. Three different objects of learning\u2014identifying numbers, comparing numbers, and operating on numbers\u2014were made visible. Further, the use of gestures strengthened the possibility for the children to make connections within and between representations. This contributes to our understanding of the importance of using representations and gestures with a pedagogical purpose.", "keywords": "Early childhood education, Gestures, Learning, Numbers, Pictures, Toddlers", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168362459"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s10643-023-01556-x"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Camilla", "first_name": "Bj\u00f6rklund", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-5436-537X"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "36991901900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60108011", "scopus-affilname": "Linnaeus University, V\u00e4xj\u00f6", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Vaxjo", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Hanna", "first_name": "Palm\u00e9r", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-2217-6624"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56417288900"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
