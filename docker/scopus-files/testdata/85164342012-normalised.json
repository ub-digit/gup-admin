Patients undergoing open-heart surgery often have several cardiovascular risk factors and a high occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF)\u2014with a high recurrence rate\u2014and are thus at a high risk of stroke. Therefore, we hypothesized that concomitant LAA closure during open-heart surgery will reduce mid-term risk of stroke independently of preoperative AF status and CHA2DS2-VASc score. Methods: This protocol describes a randomized multicenter trial. Consecutive participants \u226518 years scheduled for first-time planned open-heart surgery from cardiac surgery centers in Denmark, Spain, and Sweden are included. Both patients with a previous diagnosis of paroxysmal or chronic AF, as well as those without AF, are eligible to participate, irrespective of their CHA2DS2-VASc score. Patients already planned for ablation or LAA closure during surgery, with current endocarditis, or where follow-up is not possible are considered noneligible. Patients are stratified by site, surgery type, and preoperative or planned oral anticoagulation treatment. Subsequently, patients are randomized 1:1 to either concomitant LAA closure or standard care (ie, open LAA). The primary outcome is stroke, including transient ischemic attack, as assigned by 2 independent neurologists blinded to the treatment allocation. To recognize a 60% relative risk reduction of the primary outcome with LAA closure, 1,500 patients are randomized and followed for 2 years (significance level of 0.05 and power of 90%). Conclusions: The LAACS-2 trial is likely to impact the LAA closure approach in most patients undergoing open-heart surgery.
