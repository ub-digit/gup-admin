A case-crossover epidemiology study was associated for increased PM2.5 and trace elements with increased hospital admissions for respiratory disorders (J00-J99). The results included a significant increase in hospital admissions, with total PM2.5 of 2.7% (95% CI: 0.6, 4.9) per 10 \u00b5g\u00b7m\u22123 increase. For the trace elements, Ca of 4.0% (95% CI: 1.4%\u22126.8%), Cl of 0.7% (95% CI: 0.0%\u22121.4%), Fe of 3.3% (95% CI: 0.5%\u22126.1%), K of 1.8% (95% CI: 0.2\u20133.5) and Si of 1.3% (95% CI: 0.1%\u22122.5%). When controlling for PM2.5, only Ca of 3.2% (95% CI: 0.3, 6.1) and within the 0\u201314 age group by 5.2% (95% CI: 1.5, 9.1). Controlling for a co-pollutant that is highly correlated with PM2.5 does reduce overestimation, but further studies should include deposition rates and parallel sampling analysis.", "keywords": "&lt;PM 2.5, case-crossover, Pretoria, Respiratory disorders, Tapp", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163595543"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/09603123.2023.2229256"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
