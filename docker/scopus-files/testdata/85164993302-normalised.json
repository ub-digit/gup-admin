Previous studies, primarily based on surveys, have suggested that generalizability may be improved by exploiting data on individuals who agreed to participate only after receiving one or several reminders, as such individuals may be more similar to non-participants than what early participants are. Assessing this idea in the context of screenings, we compared sociodemographic characteristics and health across early, late, and non-participants in two large population-based screening studies in Sweden: STROKESTOP II (screening for atrial fibrillation; 6,867 participants) and SCREESCO (screening for colorectal cancer; 39,363 participants). We also explored the opportunities to reproduce the distributions of characteristics in the full invited populations, either by assuming that the non-participants were similar to the late participants, or by applying a linear extrapolation model based on both early and late participants. Findings showed that early and late participants exhibited similar characteristics along most dimensions, including civil status, education, income, and health examination results. Both these types of participants in turn differed from the non-participants, with fewer married, lower educational attainments, and lower incomes. Compared to early participants, late participants were more likely to be born outside of Sweden and to have comorbidities, with non-participants similar or even more so. The two empirical models improved representativity in some cases, but not always. Overall, we found mixed support that data on late participation may be useful for improving representativeness of screening studies.", "keywords": "Atrial fibrillation, Colorectal cancer, Continuum of resistance, Generalizability, Screening, Selection", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164993302"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.pmedr.2023.102317"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
