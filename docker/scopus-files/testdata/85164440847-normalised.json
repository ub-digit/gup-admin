Simulation-enhanced interprofessional education merits more empirical exploration particularly in terms of experiences from different perspectives. Approach: The study aims to provide a multi-perspective in-depth understanding of students\u2019 engagement in a simulation-based interprofessional learning environment. Ninety students and thirteen facilitators participated. We analyzed data from examination sheets of medical and nursing students in a simulation-enhanced interprofessional education course and from a facilitator survey, using manifest inductive content analysis. The analysis was informed by actor network theory and Sch\u00f6n\u2019s reflection on action model. Findings: Students reflected on their performance in relation to (1) personal attributes, such as systemization skills; (2) other team members, such as communication skills; and (3) the surrounding environment, such as efficient employment of resources. They also reflected on the consequences of their actions and future professional growth. We observed group differences in conceptualizations of performance and knowledge enactment. Facilitators\u2019 and students\u2019 perceptions of performance were mostly aligned. Leadership enactment in the learning environment was problematic for students as well as facilitators. Insights: Students\u2019 engagement in the learning environment helped them develop a prototype of their professional identity and explore potential domains or tools for further learning and professional growth. Features of the learning environment fostered teamwork skills and allowed students to learn from each other, thus improving performance. Our findings have several implications for education, and professional practice, including the need for meticulous planning of learning environments and the importance of more intensive pedagogical efforts for soon-to-be health professionals regarding workplace dynamics and potential conflicts. It is also important to consider that an interactive learning environment can invoke reflection on action not only among students but also among facilitators and that this can contribute to the development of clinical praxis.", "keywords": "actor network theory, Health education, interprofessional simulation, professional identity, reflection", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164440847"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/10401334.2023.2230562"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
