The first record in Sweden could be traced back to 2015, and during the autumn 2019 30 further occurrences, mainly in the eastern parts of the country, were confirmed. The habitats are in most cases gardens, but it has also spread into adjacent waste land and man-influenced woodlands. The species is highly invasive and colonises disturbed habitats where it forms large populations. Its feeding habits and possible pest status need to be studied. Further rapid spread, both west- and southwards in Europe, is to be expected. The external appearance and genital morphology of K. melanocephalus in Swedish populations are briefly described.", "keywords": "Agriolimacide, Eupulmonata, invasive species, limes norrlandicus, Man-mediated spread, pest-slug", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168336815"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.12657/folmal.028.018"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60029183", "scopus-affilname": "Naturhistoriska riksmuseet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Ted", "first_name": "von Proschwitz", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "11439478700"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
