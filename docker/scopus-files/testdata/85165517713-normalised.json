In reality, care systems are often fragmented, disjointed, and focused on the condition rather than the patient. The Science Committee of the Association of Cardiovascular Nursing and Allied Professions of the European Society of Cardiology recognizes the need for a statement on integrated care to guide health professionals caring for people with cardiovascular disease. This statement outlines the evidence for integrated cardiovascular care, identifies challenges, and offers advice for practice, education, and research.", "keywords": "Cardiovascular disease, Family/carer, Holistic, Integrated care, Multidisciplinary, Person-centred care", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165517713"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1093/eurjcn/zvad009"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
