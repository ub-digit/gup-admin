Material and methods: Data were obtained from the SCIFI-PEARL study on the entire Swedish population and on patients with oxygen-dependent CRF and no COVID-19 diagnosis before start of LTOT. Analyses were performed for three time periods; pre-alpha (Jan\u2013Dec 2020), alpha (Jan\u2013Mar 2021) and delta/omicron (Apr 2021\u2013May 2022). Cumulative incidence of laboratory-verified COVID-19 was compared between patients with CRF and the general population. Risk factors for severe (hospitalised) to critical (intensive care, or death \u226430 days after infection) COVID-19, and the impact of COVID-19 on one-year mortality, were analysed using multivariable Cox regression. Results: Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was higher in patients with CRF than in the general population during the pre-alpha period (6.4%/4.9%, p = 0.002), but less common during the alpha and delta/omicron periods (2.9%/3.8% and 7.8%/15.5%, p < 0.0001 for both). The risk of severe/critical COVID-19 was much higher in CRF patients during all periods (4.9%/0.5%, 3.8%/0.2% and 15.5%/0.5%, p < 0.0001 for all). Risk factors for COVID-19 infection in people with CRF were higher age, cardiovascular and renal disease, and COVID-19 was associated with increased one-year mortality following infection in the pre-alpha (HR 1.79; [95% CI] 1.27\u20132.53) and alpha periods (1.43; 1.03\u20131.99). Conclusion: Patients with CRF had higher risk of severe/critical COVID-19 than the general population. COVID-19 infection was associated with excess one-year mortality.", "keywords": "COVID-19, Hypoxic chronic respiratory failure, Long-term oxygen therapy, Mortality, Risk factors", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168724441"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.rmed.2023.107392"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60221525", "scopus-affilname": "Faculty of Medicine and Health", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Orebro", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Josefin", "first_name": "Sundh", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-1926-8464"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "37027281700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60003858", "scopus-affilname": "Uppsala Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Uppsala", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Andreas", "first_name": "Palm", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-0590-0417"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56567822200"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60003858", "scopus-affilname": "Uppsala Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Uppsala", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Mirjam", "first_name": "Ljunggren", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-8486-6746"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55445029400"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60003858", "scopus-affilname": "Uppsala Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Uppsala", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "\u00d6ssur Ingi", "first_name": "Emilsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "54392776800"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Ludger", "first_name": "Grote", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7006880226"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60221525", "scopus-affilname": "Faculty of Medicine and Health", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Orebro", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Sara", "first_name": "Cajander", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-3921-4244"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55363816300"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "Huiqi", "first_name": "Li", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-1127-0829"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "54794173200"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "8", "last_name": "Fredrik", "first_name": "Nyberg", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-0892-5668"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7103022770"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60118584", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper, Lund", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "9", "last_name": "Magnus", "first_name": "Ekstr\u00f6m", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-7227-5113"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "35324433300"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
