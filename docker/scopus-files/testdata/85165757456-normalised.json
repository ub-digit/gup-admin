Training for such events comprises primarily of simulations requiring significant resources and that are time-consuming and expensive. Virtual patients are defined as computer-based programs presenting authentic cases support training in trauma management. HYPOTHESIS: Assisted learning technologies augment simulated trauma team training and can improve trauma team competencies. The aim was to investigate if virtual patients increased competencies in decision making required and to identify deficiencies in care for the management of trauma patients during a multinational civil military trauma exercise. METHODS: A prospective educational intervention study with mixed methods, measuring the effects of a novel virtual patient model on trauma teams, was performed. The population consisted of surgeons, anesthesiologists, emergency department physicians, nurses, and paramedics (n = 30) and constituted six trauma teams from eight countries; three trauma teams formed the participating group, and three were allocated as control group. The participating group was exposed to virtual patients before, during, and after the live simulation exercise. Data sources were derived from individual preassessments and postassessments, evaluations made by experts in trauma, and video recordings of performance during the live simulation exercise and analyzed by the thematic analysis method. RESULTS: Using virtual patients contributed to improved individual knowledge about the management of major trauma patients and improved teamwork. Virtual patients as support for reasoning in decision making were directly correlated to level of previous knowledge and experience. Two of the three participating trauma teams showed lower levels of existing knowledge and competence in managing major trauma patients and therefore made more efficient use of the virtual patients. CONCLUSION: Results demonstrated advantages using virtual patients during a major civil military trauma live simulation exercise and appear to be supportive especially for teams who are not as experienced.
