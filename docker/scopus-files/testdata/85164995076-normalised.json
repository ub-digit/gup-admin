Clinical signs of infection are often unspecific and novel markers to complement diagnosis are needed. We investigated proteomic alterations in mouse brain after S. epidermidis infection and in preterm infant blood. We identified lipocalin-2 (LCN2) as a crucial protein associated with cerebrovascular changes and astrocyte reactivity in mice. We further proved that LCN2 protein expression was associated with endothelial cells but not astrocyte reactivity. By combining network analysis and differential expression approaches, we identified LCN2 linked to blood C-reactive protein levels in preterm infants born <28 weeks of gestation. Blood LCN2 levels were associated with similar alterations of cytokines and chemokines in both infected mice and human preterm infants with increased levels of C-reactive protein. This experimental and clinical study suggests that LCN2 may be a marker of preterm infection/inflammation associated with cerebrovascular changes and neuroinflammation.", "keywords": "Immunology, Neurology, Proteomics", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164995076"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.isci.2023.107217"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
