From this, they have inferred that technique A is more effective than technique B. But, to make a difference outside the laboratory, researchers must know if their proposed techniques can be taught to practitioners. And, if so, whether the new techniques are more effective than the ones already in use. This article will present an overview of studies where experienced police officers, handlers, and intelligence officers were trained in interrogation techniques for different situations relevant to human intelligence collection and counterintelligence. The main conclusion was that, irrespective of whether the training concerned how to detect deception, to discriminate between true and false intentions, or subtly elicit information from human sources, the studies reviewed showed that the trained professionals outperformed their untrained colleagues.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168878195"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/08850607.2023.2241307"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "P\u00e4r Anders", "first_name": "Granhag", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6701815654"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
