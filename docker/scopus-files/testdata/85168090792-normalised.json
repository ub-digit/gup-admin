Since class has become more and more of a floating concept (Standing, 2011), the need for new approaches is imminent. In recent years, a group of Swedish novelists have described precarious life among university students, which in an age of mass education can no longer be considered a middle-class reserve. Though these depictions differ in many ways, their protagonists share similar struggles to \u2018pass\u2019 in the uncertain and competitive university environment, and in late-modern existence as a whole. This article deals with one of these works, Isabell St\u00e5hl\u2019s novel Just nu \u00e4r jag h\u00e4r (Right Now I am Here, 2017). The novel depicts first-person protagonist Elise\u2019s aimless drifting through urban neo-liberal reality \u2013 poor, depressed and detached. Even though class is immanently present, its nature often appears obscured in the narration, and I address how this is linked to Elise\u2019s evasive experiences of the world and apparent unwillingness to assert a specific identity or lifestyle. I also reflect on what challenges these seemingly distant, emotionally numb depictions \u2013 not conforming to the edifying, emancipatory demands usually imposed on \u2018political\u2019 literature \u2013 evoke for literary researchers interested in the complex dialogue between art and society.", "keywords": "Isabell St\u00e5hl, liquid modernity, literature and society, precarity in literature, Swedish literature, uses of literature", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168090792"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.54432/scand/OQFS1476"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "\u00c5sa", "first_name": "Arping", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57195092701"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
