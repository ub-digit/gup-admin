Method This systematic review of qualitative studies was followed by a thematic synthesis applying an inductive approach. Studies concerning HCPs and different levels of healthcare in Europe were eligible for inclusion. The CINAHL, PubMed and Scopus databases were searched. Study titles, abstracts and full texts were screened for relevance. Included studies were assessed for methodological quality using a quality appraisal checklist. Data were extracted and synthesised via thematic synthesis, generating analytical themes. Results Seventeen studies were included in the final thematic synthesis, and eight analytical themes were derived. Most studies were conducted in Sweden and the UK and were performed in hospitals, nursing homes, elderly care and primary care. Thirteen of these studies were qualitative and four used a mixed-method design in which the qualitative part was used for analysis. HCPs experienced challenges adapting to a new remoulded professional role and felt torn and inadequate due to ambiguities between organisational structures, task-oriented care and PCC. Improved job satisfaction was experienced when providing PCC in line with ethical expectations, patients and colleagues expressed appreciation and team collaboration improved, while learning new skills generated motivation. Conclusion This systematic review found varied experiences among HCPs. Notably, the new professional role was experienced to entail disorientation and uncertainty; importantly, it also entailed experiences of job satisfaction such as meaningfulness, an improved relationship between HCPs and patients, appreciation and collaboration. To facilitate PCC implementation, healthcare organisations should focus on supporting HCPs through collaborational structures, and resources such as time, space and staffing.
