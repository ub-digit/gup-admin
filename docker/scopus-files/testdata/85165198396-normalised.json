But how should we distribute moral responsibility for these harms? In this paper, an answer is proposed to this question. This answer builds on but develops existing proposals by drawing together literatures that speak to different aspects of the question. First, it is argued that the notion of causal contribution needs to be broadened to include the idea of causation as production. Second, it is discussed how the voluntariness and foreseeability conditions are best interpreted in this context. Third, literature on moral taint is drawn to introduce additional objective (external) criteria.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165198396"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.5840/enviroethics202352653"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
