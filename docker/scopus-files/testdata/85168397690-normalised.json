The full capacity of the approach has however only rarely been used in these assessments, lacking a clear account of processes of change and flexibility of assets, as well as the ability to quantify all capital assets of a livelihood system. The descriptions of livelihoods so far are in fact non-holistic. This paper attempts to use SLA in its full capacity through a quantification of the different capitals covered; natural, physical, economic, social and human. Further, the relationships between capitals are explored in a Chinese rural context of changing climate and land-use, and examples are given on how investments in one capital in reality can end up being accounted for in other capitals. The results indicate that through an analytical and process-oriented SLA, an effective tool for assessment of vulnerability can be developed. Such a tool would assist development organizations and policy-makers to target poverty traps and escape routes in the face of rapid and multiple changes.", "keywords": "adaptation, approach, assessment tool, China, rural small-scale farmers, sustainable livelihoods, vulnerability", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168397690"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s11027-006-4421-9"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Per", "first_name": "Knutsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55789505626"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Madelene", "first_name": "Ostwald", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6603759699"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
