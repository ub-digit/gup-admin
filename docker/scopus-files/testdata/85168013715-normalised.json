These concerns are principal domains of \u201ctransportation justice\u201d (TJ) and \u201cmobility justice\u201d (MJ) scholarship that have emerged in the past decade. However, little research exists situating urban freight within these prevailing frameworks, which leaves urban freight research on socio-environmental equity and justice ill-defined, especially compared to passenger or personal mobility discussions. Through the lens that derives from TJ and MJ\u2019s critical dialogue, this study synthesises urban freight literature\u2019s engagement with equity and justice. Namely, the review evaluates: How do researchers identify equitable distributions of urban freight\u2019s costs and benefits? At what scale do researchers evaluate urban freight inequities? And who does research consider entitled to urban freight equity and how are they involved in urban freight governance? The findings help inform researchers who seek to reimagine urban freight management strategies within broader equity and justice discourse.", "keywords": "ecommerce, environmental justice, equity, last mile delivery, transportation justice, Urban freight", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168013715"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/01441647.2023.2247165"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60015481", "scopus-affilname": "University of Washington", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Seattle", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Travis", "first_name": "Fried", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-9076-487X"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57517876200"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60015481", "scopus-affilname": "University of Washington", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Seattle", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Anne", "first_name": "Goodchild", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-1595-0570"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "15062559900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Michael", "first_name": "Browne", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7101932464"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60000990", "scopus-affilname": "Chalmers University of Technology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Ivan", "first_name": "Sanchez-Diaz", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-0213-9711"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55365754800"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
