Such networks are dependent on the ability of the scaffold material to facilitate endothelial cell adhesion; however, the clinical translation potential of tissue-engineered scaffolds is hindered by the lack of available autologous sources of vascular cells. Here, we present a novel approach to achieving autologous endothelialisation in nanocellulose-based scaffolds by using adipose tissue-derived vascular cells on nanocellulose-based scaffolds. We used sodium periodate-mediated bioconjugation to covalently bind laminin to the scaffold surface and isolated the stromal vascular fraction and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs; CD31+CD45\u2212) from human lipoaspirate. Additionally, we assessed the adhesive capacity of scaffold bioconjugation in vitro using both adipose tissue-derived cell populations and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The results showed that the bioconjugated scaffold exhibited remarkably higher cell viability and scaffold surface coverage by adhesion regardless of cell type, whereas control groups comprising cells on non-bioconjugated scaffolds exhibited minimal cell adhesion across all cell types. Furthermore, on culture day 3, EPCs seeded on laminin-bioconjugated scaffolds showed positive immunofluorescence staining for the endothelial markers CD31 and CD34, suggesting that the scaffolds promoted progenitor differentiation into mature endothelial cells. These findings present a possible strategy for generating autologous vasculature and thereby increase the clinical relevance of 3D-bioprinted nanocellulose-based constructs.", "keywords": "adipose tissue, autologous endothelialisation, nanocellulose-alginate hydrogels, protein bioconjugation, sodium periodate oxidation, stromal vascular fraction", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163798436"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1088/1748-605X/acdebb"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
