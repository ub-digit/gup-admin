Our analyses demonstrate that despite differences in constructions of young fatherhood, whereby young parenthood is problematised in UK family policy, more so than in Sweden, young fathers in both countries express an encouraging commitment to contemporary cultural imperatives for engaged fatherhood. However, differences in welfare and parental leave systems have a clear influence on the extent to which the young men in the respective countries fulfil their parental commitments and act as local agents of change in the wider social project of gender equality. We argue that while policy processes and discourses in support of young parenthood and gender equality are currently treated as disparate concerns, their articulations with one another may instead be seen as complementary and symbiotic.", "keywords": "fatherhood, gender equity, international comparison, welfare system, youth", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168373866"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1332/204674321X16520100466479"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60104372", "scopus-affilname": "Linnaeus University, Kalmar", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Kalmar", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Jesper", "first_name": "Andreasson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55820474900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60026830", "scopus-affilname": "University of Lincoln", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lincoln", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United Kingdom"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Anna", "first_name": "Tarrant", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "36134091700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Thomas", "first_name": "Johansson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "35492537200"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60026830", "scopus-affilname": "University of Lincoln", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lincoln", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United Kingdom"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Linzi", "first_name": "Ladlow", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56925525600"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
