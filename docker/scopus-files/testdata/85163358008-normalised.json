Aims: To explore associations between pre-stroke physical activity and health-related quality of life 3 months after stroke onset. Methods: A consecutively collected cohort study with data from registries. Included were adult patients with first stroke in the period 2014\u20132018 who were hospitalized at any one of the three stroke units in Gothenburg, Sweden. Pre-stroke physical activity was assessed with the Saltin\u2013Grimby Physical Activity Level Scale (SGPALS) after hospital admission for acute stroke. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Level Version (EQ-5D-5L) 3 months after stroke. Data were analyzed with the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test and binary logistic regression. Results: Data were included from 2044 patients; 91% had ischemic stroke, 46% were female, and mean age was 73 years, with mild stroke severity median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 2. Patients who were pre-stroke physically active reported better overall health-related quality of life by the EQ-5D-5L index value, all the domains in EQ-5D-5L, and the EuroQoL-Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) compared with pre-stroke physically inactive patients (all p < 0.001). Better health-related quality of life 3 months after stroke was associated with pre-stroke light and moderate physical activity: adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval), 1.9 (1.5\u20132.3) and 2.3 (1.5\u20133.4), respectively. Conclusion: Pre-stroke physical activity is associated with better health-related quality of life 3 months after stroke. For the domains of mobility, self-care, and pain/discomfort, physical activity with higher intensity is even more beneficial.", "keywords": "exercise, health-related quality of life, physical activity, Pre-stroke, sedentary behavior, stroke", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163358008"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/17474930231184367"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
