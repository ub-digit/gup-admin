Neurosymptomatic (NS) CSF escape is a rare exception in which CNS HIV replication occurs in the setting of neurologic impairment. The origins of NS escape are not fully understood. We performed a case-control study of asymptomatic (AS) escape and NS escape subjects with HIV-negative subjects as controls in which we investigated differential immunoreactivity to self-antigens in the CSF of NS escape by employing neuroanatomic CSF immunostaining and massively multiplexed self-antigen serology (PhIP-Seq). Additionally, we utilized pan-viral serology (VirScan) to deeply profile the CSF anti-viral antibody response and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for pathogen detection. We detected Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA more frequently in the CSF of NS escape subjects than in AS escape subjects. Based on immunostaining and PhIP-Seq, there was evidence for increased immunoreactivity against self-antigens in NS escape CSF. Finally, VirScan revealed several immunodominant epitopes that map to the HIV envelope and gag proteins in the CSF of AS and NS escape subjects. Whether these additional inflammatory markers are byproducts of an HIV-driven process or whether they independently contribute to the neuropathogenesis of NS escape will require further study.", "keywords": "Asymptomatic escape, HIV, Metagenomic next-generation sequencing, Neuroinflammation, Neurosymptomatic escape, Programmable phage display", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164311565"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.jneuroim.2023.578141"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
