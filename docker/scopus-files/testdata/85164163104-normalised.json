We establish well-posedness for a broad class of flux functions and initial data via semigroup theory in Banach spaces and, in particular, via the celebrated Crandall\u2013Liggett Theorem. We also show that the unique mild solution satisfies a Kru\u017ekov-type nonlocal entropy inequality. Similarly to the local case, we demonstrate an efficient way of proving various desirable qualitative properties of the unique solution.", "keywords": "Conservation law, Nonlinear semigroup, Nonlocal differential equation", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164163104"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s42985-023-00249-9"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
