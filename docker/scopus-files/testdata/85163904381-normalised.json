We therefore aimed to precisely quantify the relationship between CCA-IMT and carotid plaque development. Methods and Results We undertook an individual participant data meta-analysis of 20 prospective studies from the Proof-ATHERO (Prospective Studies of Atherosclerosis) consortium that recorded baseline CCA-IMT and incident carotid plaque involving 21\u2009494 individuals without a history of cardiovascular disease and without preexisting carotid plaque at baseline. Mean baseline age was 56\u2009years (SD, 9\u2009years), 55% were women, and mean baseline CCA-IMT was 0.71\u2009mm (SD, 0.17\u2009mm). Over a median follow-up of 5.9\u2009years (5th-95th percentile, 1.9-19.0\u2009years), 8278 individuals developed first-ever carotid plaque. We combined study-specific odds ratios (ORs) for incident carotid plaque using random-effects meta-analysis. Baseline CCA-IMT was approximately log-linearly associated with the odds of developing carotid plaque. The age-, sex-, and trial arm-adjusted OR for carotid plaque per SD higher baseline CCA-IMT was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.31-1.50; I2=63.9%). The corresponding OR that was further adjusted for ethnicity, smoking, diabetes, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medication was 1.34 (95% CI, 1.24-1.45; I2=59.4%; 14 studies; 16\u2009297 participants; 6381 incident plaques). We observed no significant effect modification across clinically relevant subgroups. Sensitivity analysis restricted to studies defining plaque as focal thickening yielded a comparable OR (1.38 [95% CI, 1.29-1.47]; I2=57.1%; 14 studies; 17\u2009352 participants; 6991 incident plaques). Conclusions Our large-scale individual participant data meta-analysis demonstrated that CCA-IMT is associated with the long-term risk of developing first-ever carotid plaque, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.", "keywords": "carotid intima\u2010media thickness, carotid plaque, individual participant data meta\u2010analysis, prospective studies", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163904381"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1161/JAHA.122.027657"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
