Research shows that these chemicals can leach from the plastic product throughout the lifecycle and cause negative effects to consumers and the environment. Health effects of these chemicals range from endocrine disrupters to carcinogens, yet the fate of these chemicals is still not well understood. When considering the healthcare sector's reliance on single-use plastics, the concern of leaching chemicals to vulnerable groups of patients becomes high. Furthermore, it's paramount to consider the substitution of these chemicals to ensure nonhazardous circularity and or recyclability of materials. Findings from this review suggest that while health effects of plastic associated chemicals addressed in this review are well studied, the implications of these chemicals on the circularity of materials are novel and must be considered in product design, within comprehensive regulations, and by healthcare facilities.", "keywords": "Bisphenol a, Circular economy, Human health, Medical devices, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, Phthalates, Plastics", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165536372"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.trac.2023.117191"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
