Combining semi-structured and integrative reviews of literature on resistance in art and aesthetics across the humanities and social sciences, the paper performs a thematic analysis to identify patterns in AR\u2019s definitions, modes and domains, attributes, and transformative variables. These are synthesized in terms of the evolving resistance studies\u2019 frameworks and an understanding of aesthetics as relating to the sensorium, ultimately revealing three interlocking issues: (1) publicness, (2) potentiality, and (3) plexus. These AR-specific issues contribute to the categorization of resistance, its identification, and the tracing of its network en route to change.", "keywords": "aesthetic resistance, aesthetics, Art, resistance, sociopolitical change", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168654282"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/2158379X.2023.2245228"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60005288", "scopus-affilname": "HDK-Valand \u2013 H\u00f6gskolan f\u00f6r Konst och Design", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Tintin", "first_name": "Wulia", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-5743-6049"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57190159500"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
