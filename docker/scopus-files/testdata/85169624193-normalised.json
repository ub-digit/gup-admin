Neuroendocrine neoplasms share expression of somatostatin receptor type 2 with CD34-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells, potentially leading to active uptake in the radiosensitive red marrow region where these cells are located. This study aimed to identify and quantify specific red marrow uptake using SPECT/CT images collected after the first treatment cycle. Methods: Seventeen patients diagnosed with neuroendocrine neoplasms were treated with [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE. Seven of them had confirmed bone metastases. After the first treatment cycle, each patient went through 4 SPECT/CT imaging sessions 4, 24, 48, and 168\u2009h after administration. Monte Carlo-based reconstructions were used to quantify activity concentrations in tumors and multiple skeletal sites presumed to house red marrow: the T9-L5 vertebrae and the ilium portion of the hip bones. The activity concentration from the descending aorta was used as input in a compartment model intended to establish a pure red marrow biodistribution by separating the nonspecific blood-based contribution from the specific activity concentration in red marrow. The biodistributions from the compartment model were used to perform red marrow dosimetry at each skeletal site. Results: Increased uptake of [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE was observed in the T9-L5 vertebrae and hip bones in all 17 patients compared with activity concentrations in the aorta. The mean specific red marrow uptake was 49% (range, 0%-93%) higher than the nonspecific uptake. The median (\u00b1SD) total absorbed dose to the red marrow was 0.056\u2009\u00b1\u20090.023\u2009Gy/GBq and 0.043\u2009\u00b1\u20090.022\u2009Gy/GBq for the mean of all vertebrae and hip bones, respectively. The patients with bone metastases had an absorbed dose of 0.085\u2009\u00b1\u20090.046\u2009Gy/GBq and 0.069\u2009\u00b1\u20090.033\u2009Gy/GBq for the vertebrae and hip bones, respectively. The red marrow elimination phase was statistically slower in patients with fast tumor elimination, which is in line with transferrin transport of 177Lu back to the red marrow. Conclusion: Our results suggest that specific red marrow uptake of [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE is in line with observations of somatostatin receptor type 2-expressing hematopoietic progenitor cells within the bone marrow. Blood-based dosimetry methods fail to account for the prolonged elimination of specific uptake and underestimate the absorbed dose to red marrow.", "keywords": "177Lu, dosimetry, DOTATATE, red marrow, SPECT", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169624193"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.2967/jnumed.123.265484"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60004831", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Jens", "first_name": "Hemmingsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57191275763"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60004831", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Johanna", "first_name": "Svensson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "36450021200"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60004831", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Andreas", "first_name": "Hallqvist", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "22634126500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60004831", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Katja", "first_name": "Smits", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58560822500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60004831", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Viktor", "first_name": "Johanson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6701458084"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60004831", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Kliniska Vetenskaper", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Peter", "first_name": "Bernhardt", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7103130666"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
