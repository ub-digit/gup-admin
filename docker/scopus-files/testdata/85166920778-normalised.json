Methods: A cross-sectional design used the 30-item FATCOD-B questionnaire. It was distributed to intensive care professionals from Sweden and Saudi Arabia, generating a total sample of 227 participants. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to examine the differential item functioning (DIF) for each item. Results: Up to 12 of the 30 items were found to have significant DIF values related to: (a) Swedish and Saudi Arabian intensive care professionals, (b) Swedish and Saudi Arabian registered nurses (RNs), (c) RNs\u2019 levels of experience and (d) RNs and other intensive care professionals in Saudi Arabia. Conclusions: The results indicate that FATCOD should be used cautiously when comparing attitudes towards death and dying across different societal and healthcare contexts.", "keywords": "Attitude scale, Death and dying, Differential item functioning, Intensive care, Ordinal logistic regression, Palliative care", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166920778"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e18864"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
