As the two fields use similar techniques there is great hope that technologies from one field could be used in the other. In this spirit, we provide an alternative reduction from the supervisor synthesis problem to solving B&#x00FC;chi games via games with a non-blocking objective. Our reduction is more compact and uniform than previous reductions. As a consequence, it gives an asymptotically better upper bound on the time complexity of the supervisory control synthesis problem. Our reduction also breaks a widely held belief about the impossibility of reducing the supervisory control synthesis problem to a game with a linear winning condition.", "keywords": "Discrete event systems, Encoding, Forestry, Game theory, Games, Runtime, Software algorithms, Supervisory control, Supervisory control, Upper bound", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163453808"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1109/LCSYS.2023.3290727"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
