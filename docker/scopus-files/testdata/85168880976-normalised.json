The main aim of the current paper is to evaluate HRQoL, and possible factors influencing HRQoL, in individuals with severe asthma. The aim is also to explore associations among anxiety, depression, beliefs of medication, self-efficacy, and HRQoL among individuals with severe and other asthma as well as those with no asthma. Methods: Participants with severe asthma (n = 59), other asthma (n = 526), and no asthma (n = 902) were recruited from West Sweden Asthma Study, a population-based study, which includes both questionnaire surveys and clinical examinations. Results: Individuals with severe asthma had worse physical HRQoL (measured with SF-8) than those with other and no asthma (median 48.4, 51.9, and 54.3, respectively). They also had worse mental HRQoL (median 46.7) and reported higher anxiety and depression scores (measured using HADS, median 5.0 and 3.5, respectively) compared to no asthma (median 4.0 and 2.0, respectively). HRQoL was particularly affected among women with severe asthma. Individuals with severe asthma believed that their asthma medication was more necessary than those with other asthma, but they reported more concern for the medication. Asthma control and packyears predicted physical HRQoL and anxiety predicted mental HRQoL among individuals with severe asthma. Conclusions: Efforts to improve asthma control and to reduce anxiety may improve HRQoL in individuals with severe asthma. Especially, women with severe asthma seem to need support to improve their HRQoL. Reducing concerns with asthma medication is most likely essential as high concerns may lead to poor adherence, which in turn may negatively affect asthma control and HRQoL.", "keywords": "clinical variables, Difficult asthma, epidemiology, health psychology, physical functioning, treatable traits, well-being", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168880976"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/02770903.2023.2248512"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "L.", "first_name": "R\u00f6nnebjerg", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57274126000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60007905", "scopus-affilname": "Malm\u00f6 H\u00f6gskola", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Malmo", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "M.", "first_name": "Axelsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "36174817900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60070297", "scopus-affilname": "Seinajoki Central Hospital", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Seinajoki", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Finland"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60011170", "scopus-affilname": "Tampere University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Tampere", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Finland"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "H.", "first_name": "Kankaanranta", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7004502353"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "L.", "first_name": "Ekerljung", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "24721491300"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
