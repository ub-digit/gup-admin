While visual, auditory, tactile and olfactory perception are conveyed by direct evidentials in contexts where such interpretations are appropriate, in others it is the speaker\u2019s involvement, affectedness and established beliefs which are conveyed. These may be exclusive to the speaker or shared by the addressee. Instead of information source, it is argued that some direct evidentials encode the speaker\u2019s epistemic authority regarding an event based on their primary relation to the event. Epistemic authority concerns the speaker\u2019s rights over knowledge and is therefore a relational concept that captures some of the dynamics between speech act participants in terms of knowledge representation and attribution. Support for this argument comes from the diachronic development of direct evidentials, the effects of co-distribution between direct evidentials and person marking (egophoricity), and patterns of use. Data comes from the literature on evidentiality and frequently cited languages from Tucanoan and Quechuan languages that feature well-described, rich evidential systems.", "keywords": "epistemic authority, evidentiality, grammaticalization, pragmatics", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168291385"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1075/fol.22006.ber"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
