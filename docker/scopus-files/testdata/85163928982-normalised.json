To date, data regarding possible associations between plasma Gal-4 and stroke are lacking. Using linear and logistic regression analyses, we tested Gal-4 association with prevalent stroke in a population-based cohort. Additionally, in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), we investigated whether plasma Gal-4 increases in response to ischemic stroke. Plasma Gal-4 was higher in subjects with prevalent ischemic stroke, and was associated with prevalent ischemic stroke (odds ratio 1.52; 95% confidence interval 1.01\u20132.30; p = 0.048) adjusted for age, sex, and covariates of cardiometabolic health. Plasma Gal-4 increased after experimental stroke in both controls and HFD-fed mice. HFD exposure was devoid of impact on Gal-4 levels. This study demonstrates higher plasma Gal-4 levels in both experimental stroke and in humans that experienced ischemic stroke.", "keywords": "cardiovascular disease, diabetes, galectins, ischemic stroke, obesity", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163928982"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/ijms241210064"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
