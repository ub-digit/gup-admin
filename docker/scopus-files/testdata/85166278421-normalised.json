ESBL-E. coli sequence type (ST) 131 is the dominating clone worldwide, especially its subclade C2. Patients developing recurrent UTI (RUTI) due to ST131 subclade C2 appear to have an increased risk of recurrent infections. We have thus compared the whole genome of ST131 subclade C2 isolates from 14 patients with RUTI to those from 14 patients with sporadic UTI (SUTI). We aimed to elucidate if isolates causing RUTI can be associated with specific genomic features. Paired isolates from patients with RUTI were identical, presenting 2-18 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences for all six patients investigated. Comparative genomic analyses, including virulence factors, antibiotic resistance, pangenome and SNP analyses did not find any pattern associated with isolates causing RUTI. Despite extensive whole genome analyses, an increased risk of recurrences seen in patients with UTI due to ST131 subclade C2 isolates could not be explained by bacterial genetic differences in the two groups of isolates. Hence, additional factors that could aid in identifying bacterial properties contributing to the increased risk of RUTI due to ESBL-E. coli ST131 subclade C2 remains to be explored.", "keywords": "E. coli, ESBL, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, recurrent urinary tract infection, ST131 subclade C2, UTI, whole genome sequencing", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166278421"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/microorganisms11071622"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
