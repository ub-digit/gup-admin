Maximal oxygen consumption is related with outcome. Objectives: This study assessed ventricular function by advanced echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging at rest and during exercise, to determine exercise capacity in ASO patients, and to correlate exercise capacity with ventricular function as potential early marker of subclinical impairment. Methods: Forty-four patients (71% male, mean age 25 \u00b1 4 years - range 18\u201340 years) were included during routine clinical follow-up. Assessment involved physical examination, 12\u2011lead ECG, echocardiography, and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) (day 1). On day 2 CMR imaging at rest and during exercise was performed. Blood was sampled for biomarkers. Results: All patients reported New York Heart Association class I, the overall cohort had an impaired exercise capacity (80 \u00b1 14% of predicted peak oxygen consumption). Fragmented QRS was present in 27%. Exercise CMR showed that 20% of patients had abnormal contractile reserve (CR) of the left ventricle (LV) and 25% had reduced CR of the right ventricle (RV). CR LV and CR RV were significantly associated with impaired exercise capacity. Pathological patterns on myocardial delayed enhancement and hinge point fibrosis were detected. Biomarkers were normal. Conclusion: This study found that in some asymptomatic ASO patients electrical, LV and RV changes at rest, and signs of fibrosis are present. Maximal exercise capacity is impaired and seems to be linearly related to the CR of the LV and the RV. Therefore, exercise CMR might play a role in detecting subclinical deterioration of ASO patients.", "keywords": "Arterial switch operation, Contractile reserve, Impaired exercise capacity, Transposition of the great arteries", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165242926"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.ijcard.2023.131153"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
