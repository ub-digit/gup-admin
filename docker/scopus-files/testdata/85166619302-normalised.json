Methods: Responses to questionnaires (N = 1182) between groups with and without self-reported glaucoma were analysed. Questionnaires included National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25), Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), physical activity, socioeconomics, alcohol and tobacco consumption. Balance test and body mass index were also included. About half of the participants were randomized to ophthalmic examination (N = 560), variables were analysed separately according to known and confirmed glaucoma, ocular hypertension and/or cases of previously unknown glaucoma. Results: Both conventional and Rasch analysis of the NEI VFQ-25 showed that VRQoL was lower for individuals self-reporting glaucoma (p = 0.003/p = 0.024). Regarding general QoL, the participants did not differ apart from people self-reporting glaucoma reported worse general health (p = 0.01). Using logistic regression with lower VRQoL as the dependent variable glaucoma was not a significant predictor of poor VRQoL, odds ratio (OR) 1.83 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76\u20134.39, p = 0.18). Low household income was associated with lower VRQoL (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.14\u20132.33, p = 0.01). Socioeconomics, physical activity and lifestyle factors were comparable between the groups (N = 915). Among participants who underwent ophthalmic examination no significant differences were found between glaucoma cases and non-glaucoma cases in relation to VRQoL (N = 560). Conclusions: Patients with self-reported glaucoma assessed a lower VRQoL but not lower general quality of life. Poorer household income was associated with worse VRQoL. General health was reported low in the glaucoma population but lifestyle or physical factors did not diverge.", "keywords": "ageing, cross-sectional study, glaucoma, self-reporting, vision-related quality of life", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166619302"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/aos.15737"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
