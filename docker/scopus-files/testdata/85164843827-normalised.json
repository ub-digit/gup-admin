In the present study, we rederived Cyp2c70-/- mice as germ-free (GF) and colonized them with a human or a mouse microbiota to investigate whether the presence of a microbiota can be protective in cholangiopathic liver disease associated with Cyp2c70-deficiency. GF Cyp2c70-/- mice showed reduced neonatal survival, liver fibrosis, and distinct cholangiocyte proliferation. Colonization of germ-free breeding pairs with a human or a mouse microbiota normalized neonatal survival of the offspring, and particularly colonization with mouse microbiota from a conventionally raised mouse improved the liver phenotype at 6-10 weeks of age. The improved liver phenotype in conventionalized (CD) Cyp2c70-/- mice was associated with increased levels of tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and UDCA, resulting in a more hydrophilic bile acid profile compared with GF and humanized Cyp2c70-/- mice. The hydrophobicity index of biliary bile acids of CD Cyp2c70-/- mice was associated with changes in gut microbiota, liver weight, liver transaminases, and liver fibrosis. Hence, our results indicate that neonatal survival of Cyp2c70-/- mice seems to depend on the establishment of a gut microbiota at birth, and the improved liver phenotype in CD Cyp2c70-/- mice may be mediated by a larger proportion of TUDCA/UDCA in the circulating bile acid pool and/or by the presence of specific bacteria.", "keywords": "bile acids, cyp2c70, faecal microbiota transplantation, gut microbiota, hepatobiliary disease, ursodeoxycholic acid", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164843827"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1042/CS20230413"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
