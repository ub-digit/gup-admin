Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective single-center analysis of all patients undergoing XEN 45 stent surgery between December 2015 and May 2017. The main outcome was success rate according to several definitions of success. Subgroup analysis was performed. Secondary outcomes were change in intraocular pressure (IOP) and number of IOP-lowering agents. Need for secondary glaucoma surgery, needling rate and complications were recorded. Results: A total of 103 eyes could be evaluated after four years. Mean age was 70.6 years. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) accounted for 46.6% and exfoliative glaucoma (PEXG) for 39.8%. Mean IOP dropped from 24.0 to 15.9 mmHg (p<0.001) and IOP-lowering agents from 3.5 to 1.5 (p<0.001). The success rate with individual target pressures after four years was 43.7%. Secondary glaucoma surgery was performed in 45 (43.7%) of cases. Combined cases (n=12) were not statistically different to stand-alone procedures (p=0.28). No difference between PEXG and POAG could be detected (p=0.44). During the learning curve, stent misplacement was common and resulted in worse outcome for less experienced surgeons. Conclusion: The overall success rate of XEN 45 gel stent surgery in the present cohort is relatively low in a long-time follow-up under the given circumstances if all initial patients are included to follow-up. The influence of the surgeon\u2019s learning curve is obvious, and improvement in success can be expected when used by experienced and high-volume surgeons. No significant differences were found in PEXG compared to POAG or in XEN surgery combined with cataract surgery compared to stand-alone.", "keywords": "ab interno implant, glaucoma, minimal invasive glaucoma surgery, pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, surgical success, XEN 45 gel stent", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164427321"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.2147/OPTH.S412400"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
