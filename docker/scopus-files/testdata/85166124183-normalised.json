Methods Data were extracted from a rehabilitation-specific registry for 16-50-year-old patients treated with ACL-R between 2014 and 2019. Demographics, outcome data and the incidence of a second ACL injury within 12 months of RTS, defined as a new ipsilateral or contralateral ACL, were compared between patients with and without GJH. Univariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were performed to determine the influence of GJH and time of RTS on the odds of a second ACL injury, and ACL-R survival without a second ACL injury after RTS. Results A total of 153 patients, 50 (22.2%) with GJH and 175 (77.8%) without GJH, were included. Within 12 months of RTS, 7 (14.0%) patients with GJH and 5 (2.9%) without GJH had a second ACL injury (p=0.012). The odds of sustaining a second ipsilateral or contralateral ACL injury were 5.53 (95% CI 1.67 to 18.29) higher in patients with GJH compared with patients without GJH (p=0.014). The lifetime HR of a second ACL injury after RTS was 4.24 (95% CI 2.05 to 8.80; p=0.0001) in patients with GJH. No between-group differences were observed in patient-reported outcome measures. Conclusion Patients with GJH undergoing ACL-R have over five times greater odds of sustaining a second ACL injury after RTS. The importance of joint laxity assessment should be emphasised in patients who aim to return to high-intensity sports following ACL-R.", "keywords": "Anterior Cruciate Ligament, Knee injuries, Sports medicine", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166124183"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1136/bjsports-2022-106183"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "B\u00e1lint", "first_name": "Zsidai", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-5697-6577"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57219706181"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "100637407", "scopus-affilname": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Ramana", "first_name": "Piussi", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57211556976"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Roland", "first_name": "Thome\u00e9", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6701392483"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "David", "first_name": "Sundemo", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-5871-1636"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57185761600"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60011838", "scopus-affilname": "UPMC Sports Medicine", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Pittsburgh", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Volker", "first_name": "Musahl", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6602676620"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "127040662", "scopus-affilname": "Institute of Clinical Sciences", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Kristian", "first_name": "Samuelsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "26658678500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "100637407", "scopus-affilname": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "Eric", "first_name": "Hamrin Senorski", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-9340-0147"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57190662515"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
