The objectives were to develop and validate a neural network-based slice-wise whole-lung emphysema score (SWES) for chest CT, to validate SWES on unseen CT data, and to compare SWES with a conventional quantitative CT method. Materials and methods: Separate cohorts were used for algorithm development and validation. For validation, thin-slice CT stacks from 474 participants in the prospective cross-sectional Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS) were included, 395 randomly selected and 79 from an emphysema cohort. Spirometry (FEV1/FVC) and radiologists\u2019 visual emphysema scores (sum-visual) obtained at inclusion in SCAPIS were used as reference tests. SWES was compared with a commercially available quantitative emphysema scoring method (LAV950) using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. Results: SWES correlated more strongly with the visual scores than LAV950 (r = 0.78 vs. r = 0.41, p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve for the prediction of airway obstruction was larger for SWES than for LAV950 (0.76 vs. 0.61, p = 0.007). SWES correlated more strongly with FEV1/FVC than either LAV950 or sum-visual in the full cohort (r = \u2212 0.69 vs. r = \u2212 0.49/r = \u2212 0.64, p < 0.001/p = 0.007), in the emphysema cohort (r = \u2212 0.77 vs. r = \u2212 0.69/r = \u2212 0.65, p = 0.03/p = 0.002), and in the random sample (r = \u2212 0.39 vs. r = \u2212 0.26/r = \u2212 0.25, p = 0.001/p = 0.007). Conclusion: The slice-wise whole-lung emphysema score (SWES) correlates better than LAV950 with radiologists\u2019 visual emphysema scores and correlates better with airway obstruction than do LAV950 and radiologists\u2019 visual scores. Clinical relevance statement: The slice-wise whole-lung emphysema score provides quantitative emphysema information for CT imaging that avoids the disadvantages of threshold-based scores and is correlated more strongly with reference tests than LAV950 and reader visual scores. Key Points: \u2022 A slice-wise whole-lung emphysema score (SWES) was developed to quantify emphysema in chest CT images. \u2022 SWES identified visual emphysema and spirometric airflow limitation significantly better than threshold-based score (LAV950). \u2022 SWES improved emphysema quantification in CT images, which is especially useful in large-scale research.", "keywords": "Deep learning, Lung, Pulmonary disease, chronic obstructive, Pulmonary emphysema, Tomography, X-ray computed", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167352439"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s00330-023-09985-3"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
