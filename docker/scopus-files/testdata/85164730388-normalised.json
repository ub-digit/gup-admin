Thus, there is a need for population-based studies investigating place of death and associated factors among foreign-born individuals. Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify variations in place of death among foreign-born individuals residing in Sweden and to compare place of death between the foreign- and domestic-born population. We also examine the association between place of death, underlying cause of death and sociodemographic characteristics among the foreign-born population. Design: A population-based register study. Methods: All deceased individuals \u2a7e18 years of age in Sweden with a registered place of death between 2012 and 2019 (n = 682,697). Among these, 78,466 individuals were foreign-born. Univariable multinomial logistic regression modelling and multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: Overall, hospital was the most common place of death among the foreign-born population. However, there were variations in place of death related to region of birth. Compared to domestic-born, a higher proportion of foreign-born individuals dies at home, the majority of whom were born on the African continent. Conclusion: Region of birth is one of the several factors associated with place of death among foreign-born individuals. Further research is needed to explore both preferences and barriers to place of death among foreign-born individuals.", "keywords": "cause of death, death certificates, health inequities, immigrants, palliative care, place of death, socioeconomic factors", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164730388"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/26323524231185157"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
