Methods: One hundred and fifteen patients with tick-borne encephalitis diagnosed in Lithuania and Sweden were prospectively included, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples were obtained shortly after hospitalization. Using pre-defined criteria, cases were classified as mild, moderate or severe tick-borne encephalitis. Additionally, the presence of spinal nerve paralysis (myelitis) and/or cranial nerve affection were noted. Concentrations of the brain cell biomarkers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), YKL-40, S100B, neurogranin, neurofilament light (NfL) and tau were analysed in CSF and, in addition, NfL, GFAP and S100B levels were measured in serum. The Jonckheere-Terpstra test was used for group comparisons of continuous variables and Spearman's partial correlation test was used to adjust for age. Results: Cerebrospinal fluid and serum concentrations of GFAP and NfL correlated with disease severity, independent of age, and with the presence of nerve paralysis. The markers neurogranin, YKL-40, tau and S100B in CSF and S100B in serum were detected, but their concentrations did not correlate with disease severity. Conclusions: Neuronal cell damage and astroglial cell activation with increased NfL and GFAP in CSF and serum were associated with a more severe disease, independent of age. Increased GFAP and NfL concentrations in CSF and NfL in serum were also indicative of spinal and/or cranial nerve damage. NfL and GFAP are promising prognostic biomarkers in tick-borne encephalitis, and future studies should focus on determining the association between these biomarkers and long-term sequelae.", "keywords": "central nervous system, neurofilament, neuroglia, tick-borne encephalitis, viral encephalitis", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165445342"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/ene.15978"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
