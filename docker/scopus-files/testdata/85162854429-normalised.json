This study investigated the impact of PFAPA syndrome on the families of affected children, the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of children with the syndrome, and how these factors were influenced by tonsillectomy. Methods: This prospective cohort study included 24 children with typical PFAPA syndrome that were referred for tonsillectomy, of whom 20 underwent the procedure. The control group consisted of randomly selected children from the general population. Family impact and HRQOL were measured using the standardized, validated questionnaires Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory\u2122 (PedsQL\u2122) Family Impact Module (FIM) and PedsQL\u2122 4.0 Generic Core Scales (GCS). Parents to children with PFAPA completed the questionnaires before and 6\u00a0months after their child underwent tonsillectomy, and HRQOL was measured both between and during PFAPA episodes. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare data before and after tonsillectomy in the patient group, while the Mann\u2013Whitney test was used for comparison of the patient and control groups. Results: Before tonsillectomy, children with PFAPA had significantly lower scores than the control group on the PedsQL\u2122 FIM and the PedsQL\u2122 4.0 GCS during fever episodes. After tonsillectomy, all patients improved with diminished febrile episodes, which resulted in significantly higher scores regarding both family impact and HRQOL at the time of follow-up. HRQOL of in children with PFAPA improved after tonsillectomy even when compared to afebrile intervals before the procedure. The differences between PFAPA patients and controls were eliminated after tonsillectomy. Conclusion: PFAPA syndrome has a profound negative impact on the families of affected children. Tonsillectomy that leads to cessation or reduction of fever episodes eases the impact of the disease on the family. HRQOL in children with PFAPA is low during febrile episodes and similar to healthy controls in between episodes. The improvement of HRQOL in patients with PFAPA after tonsillectomy compared to the afebrile intervals before tonsillectomy highlights that the constantly recurring fevers may affect the children\u2019s well-being even between fever episodes.", "keywords": "Autoinflammatory disorders, Family impact, Health-related quality of life, Periodic fever, Tonsillectomy", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162854429"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s13023-023-02773-8"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
