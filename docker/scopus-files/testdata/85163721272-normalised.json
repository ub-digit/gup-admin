To establish an effective workflow enabling quantitative analysis of changes in protein conformation within multiple samples simultaneously, here we report the combination of N,N-dimethyl leucine (DiLeu) isobaric tag labeling with limited proteolysis mass spectrometry (DiLeu-LiP-MS) for high-throughput structural protein quantitation in serum samples collected from AD patients and control donors. Twenty-three proteins were discovered to undergo structural changes, mapping to 35 unique conformotypic peptides with significant changes between the AD group and the control group. Seven out of 23 proteins, including CO3, CO9, C4BPA, APOA1, APOA4, C1R, and APOA, exhibited a potential correlation with AD. Moreover, we found that complement proteins (e.g., CO3, CO9, and C4BPA) related to AD exhibited elevated levels in the AD group compared to those in the control group. These results provide evidence that the established DiLeu-LiP-MS method can be used for high-throughput structural protein quantitation, which also showed great potential in achieving large-scale and in-depth quantitative analysis of protein conformational changes in other biological systems.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163721272"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1021/acs.analchem.2c05731"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
