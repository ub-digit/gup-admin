Based on a randomised trial, showing five months increased survival, TTF has been introduced in the management of patients with good performance status. Data from the Swedish national quality registry for CNS tumours have been analysed for TTF usage. The results demonstrate that 65 percent of the patients accepted treatment with TTF. More than half of the treated patients interrupted treatment due to low compliance or their own wish. Median treatment time was 164 days, with a range from 0 to 774 days. There was a large variation between different regions in how many patients were offered TTF treatment. A non-significant trend to better survival was seen for the group of TTF-treated patients compared to individually matched controls. In summary, TTF is a new treatment for glioblastoma, with potential to prolong survival also in real world patients. Today, the treatment is not offered equally to all patients, despite national guidelines.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164005813"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
