It takes the UN and the Council of Europe\u2019s models as points of departure and develops the framework beyond the current state of the art, explains its different components, and offers reflections on its use in the practice of gender-based violence research. The UN 3P model, encompassing prevention, protection, and prosecution, later developed by the Council of Europe\u2019s Istanbul Convention into a 4P model, comprising prevention, protection, prosecution, and integrated policies, has since been revisited, elaborated upon, and expanded in work focusing on gender-based violence in particular domains, such as female genital mutilation or gender-based violence in sport. To study gender-based violence in academia, the comprehensive 7Ps analytical framework has been deployed to interrogate the policies in place at national and institutional levels, including sexual harassment. Based on empirical data and conceptual analysis in the EU project UniSAFE: Gender-based violence and institutional responses: Building a knowledge base and operational tools to make universities and research organisations safe (2021\u20132024), the paper argues that the refined 7Ps model, comprising Prevalence, Prevention, Protection, Prosecution of offenders (and disciplinary measures), Provision of services, Partnerships between actors, and Policies specifically addressing the issue, allows for a more encompassing approach, in turn allowing a more fine-grained understanding of variations and explanations for success (or lack thereof) in terms of outcomes.", "keywords": "7P, gender-based violence (GBV), higher education, policy analysis, research", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166403839"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/socsci12070385"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "112652740", "scopus-affilname": "YELLOW WINDOW", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Antwerpen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Belgium"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Lut", "first_name": "Mergaert", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-4692-1097"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "35330527000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60068912", "scopus-affilname": "Sociologick\u00fd \u00fastav AV \u010cR, v.v.i.", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Prague", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Czech Republic"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Marcela", "first_name": "Linkov\u00e1", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-3982-6980"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "12753043900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60008141", "scopus-affilname": "\u00d6rebro Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Orebro", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Sofia", "first_name": "Strid", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-7822-4563"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55148353200"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
