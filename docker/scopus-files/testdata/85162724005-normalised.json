Our main objective is that it will be useful as a horizontally explicit and vertically implicit (HEVI) method for atmospheric models. In our method the diagonal coefficients in the implicit part are all equal, and the HEVI-stability properties seem to be excellent. Further, the accuracies obtained for two simple test problems, used with different resolutions and integration intervals, considerably surpass those of a third order one step Runge-Kutta method also with four stages, used for comparison.", "keywords": "Atmospheric model, HEVI, Partitioned method, Time integration, Two step Runge-Kutta method", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162724005"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.16993/tellusa.342"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
