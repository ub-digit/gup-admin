Methods: Of the entire cohort (n = 1203), 1182 participants responded a questionnaire on self-reported glaucoma and were tested for blood pressure (BP) and diabetes. In all, 560 participants underwent ophthalmic examination including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), central corneal thickness (CCT), contrast sensitivity (CS), perimetry and photos of the retina and lens. Results: Glaucoma prevalence was 4.8% (95% confidence interval, 3.0%\u20136.6%), of which 56% was previously undiagnosed. The proportion of participants with diastolic BP >90 mmHg was higher in the non-glaucomatous group (8.3%) than the glaucoma group (0%), p < 0.001. A family history of glaucoma was present in a larger proportion of the glaucoma group (39%) than of the non-glaucomatous group (1.1%), p = 0.001. Mean IOP in individuals without glaucoma was 16 mmHg, versus 21 mmHg in participants with glaucoma detected at the examination. IOP was \u226421 mmHg in 67% among participants with previously unknown glaucoma. BCVA was lower in eyes with previously unknown glaucoma than in eyes without glaucoma (p = 0.017) but BCVA in the best eye did not differ. CCT and CS were similar in all cases. Conclusions: The prevalence of glaucoma was comparable to that reported previously. A family history of glaucoma and higher IOP were risk factors associated with glaucoma. BCVA in the best eye did not differ significantly between subjects with and without glaucoma.", "keywords": "ageing, best-corrected visual acuity, cross-sectional study, glaucoma, risk factors, visual field", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165260002"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/aos.15734"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
