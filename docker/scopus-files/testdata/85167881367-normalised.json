It has amplified existing challenges, such as shortages of medical supplies and personnel, outdated infrastructure, and restricted access to healthcare services. Destruction of medical facilities, non-adherence to prevention and treatment standards, lack of medical personnel and supplies, and logistical disruptions are hampering the provision of timely healthcare to the Ukrainian population. This study employed a rapid review methodology to synthesize available research concerning the healthcare crisis in Ukraine, with an explicit focus on the war\u2019s sustained impact on the healthcare system. Through this review, a series of critical challenges facing Ukraine\u2019s healthcare system were identified. These included the shortage of medical supplies and personnel, insufficient infrastructure, and funding deficits. Additionally, the review brought to light various interventions and strategies aimed at counteracting these challenges. These comprised international aid and support, initiatives enhancing the resilience of the Ukrainian health system, and others. Given the ongoing war, this review highlighted the pressing need for continuous support and investment in the Ukrainian healthcare system. This commitment is essential to guarantee access to quality healthcare for the Ukrainian population during the war and in its aftermath. The findings presented here can serve as a guide for policymakers and healthcare professionals working not only in Ukraine but also in other regions impacted by war. These insights can inform the development and implementation of effective strategies and interventions tailored to such challenging contexts.", "keywords": "armed conflicts, emergency medicine, health crisis, health infrastructure resilience, healthcare system, post-conflict reconstruction, public health challenges, sustainability, Ukraine, war, war impact", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167881367"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/su151511602"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60272131", "scopus-affilname": "Polish Air Force University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Deblin", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Poland"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Krzysztof", "first_name": "Goniewicz", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-4368-6850"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55315144500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60004398", "scopus-affilname": "Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Washington, D.C.", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Frederick M.", "first_name": "Burkle", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-5110-7284"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57223896323"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60005421", "scopus-affilname": "Bogomolets National Medical University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Kiev", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Ukraine"}, {"scopus-afid": "130034217", "scopus-affilname": "Alexander Clinical Hospital", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Kyiv", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Ukraine"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Marta", "first_name": "Dzhus", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-7500-8520"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6506674291"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Amir", "first_name": "Khorram-Manesh", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-2734-5733"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6602425919"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
