Material and methods: We studied 30 years outcome of 4124 postmenopausal patients who were randomized to receive (totally) two or five years of adjuvant tamoxifen. Results: After 5 years of follow-up, when tamoxifen treatment was finished in both groups, until 15 years of follow-up, overall mortality (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72\u20130.90, p < 0.001), breast cancer mortality for all patients (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68\u20130.94, p = 0.006) and breast cancer mortality for patients with estrogen receptor positive disease (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.55\u20130.83, p < 0.001) were significantly reduced in the five-year group as compared to the two-year group. After 15 years, the difference remained but did not further increase. In the five-year group, the incidence of contralateral breast cancer was gradually reduced during the entire period of observation. The incidence of lung cancer was also reduced in the five-year group. In contrast there was an increased endometrial cancer incidence in the five-year group and for those receiving 40 mg of tamoxifen this incidence was further increased. Conclusion: Three more years of tamoxifen therapy reduced the risk of breast cancer mortality. The difference was established during the first 15 years after randomization. Moreover, the incidence of contralateral breast cancer gradually decreased for 30 years. The incidence of lung cancer was reduced in the five-year group. In contrast the incidence of endometrial cancer was increased.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166060582"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.breast.2023.07.010"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
