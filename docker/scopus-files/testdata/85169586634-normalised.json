In this study, we explore if Rho-GTPases define the joint destination of pathogenic leukocytes, the mechanism by which they perpetuate rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and how JAK inhibition mitigates these effects. Methods: CD14+ cells of 136 RA patients were characterized by RNA sequencing and cytokine measurement to identify biological processes and transcriptional regulators specific for CDC42hiCD14+ cells, which were summarized in a metabolic signature (MetSig). The effect of hypoxia and IFN-\u03b3 signaling on the metabolic signature of CD14+ cells was assessed experimentally. To investigate its connection with joint inflammation, the signature was translated into the single-cell characteristics of CDC42hi synovial tissue macrophages. The sensitivity of MetSig to the RA disease activity and the treatment effect were assessed experimentally and clinically. Results: CDC42hiCD14+ cells carried MetSig of genes functional in the oxidative phosphorylation and proteasome-dependent cell remodeling, which correlated with the cytokine-rich migratory phenotype and antigen-presenting capacity of these cells. Integration of CDC42hiCD14+ and synovial macrophages marked with MetSig revealed the important role of the interferon-rich environment and immunoproteasome expression in the homeostasis of these pathogenic macrophages. The CDC42hiCD14+ cells were targeted by JAK inhibitors and responded with the downregulation of immunoproteasome and MHC-II molecules, which disintegrated the immunological synapse, reduced cytokine production, and alleviated arthritis. Conclusion: This study shows that the CDC42-related MetSig identifies the antigen-presenting CD14+ cells that migrate to joints to coordinate autoimmunity. The accumulation of CDC42hiCD14+ cells discloses patients perceptive to the JAKi treatment.", "keywords": "arthritis, CD14  cells +, oxidative phosphorylation, proteasome, Rho-GTPases, synovia", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169586634"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3389/fimmu.2023.1187093"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Eric", "first_name": "Malmh\u00e4ll-Bah", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57201069022"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Karin M.E.", "first_name": "Andersson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56519061500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Malin C.", "first_name": "Erlandsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6603879102"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Sofia T.", "first_name": "Silfversw\u00e4rd", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56716356300"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Rille", "first_name": "Pullerits", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "12799778100"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Maria I.", "first_name": "Bokarewa", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7004270660"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
