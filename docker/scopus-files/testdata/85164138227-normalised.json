Its ease of use and lack of floor and ceiling effects culminated in recommendations for inclusion in a battery of tests to measure outcome following upper limb reconstructive surgery. However, the length of time taken to administer the GRT in a clinical setting, lack of instructions of accepted grasp patterns in the upper limb reconstructive surgery population and scoring procedures lead to differences in reporting outcomes using this measure. In order to ensure clinical utility for the upper limb reconstructive surgery population, revisions of the original test instructions have been made and are reported in this article. Further testing of the psychometric properties of the new measure are currently underway.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164138227"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1038/s41393-023-00907-0"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
