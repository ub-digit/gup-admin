Background: To improve maternal and neonatal health, there is a government policy in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to educate midwives at a higher education level according to international norms. This study investigates contextual factors and their influence on the implementation of a midwifery education programme which is based on national curriculum and has a profile of person-centred care, simulation-based learning pedagogy and information and communication technology. Method: A qualitative study was conducted with data collected through semi-structured interviews with 22 participants who were directly or indirectly involved in establishing the midwifery education programme. Transcribed interviews were analysed using content analysis. Results: The factors influencing the implementation of the new midwifery education programme comprise facilitating and hindering factors. Facilitating factors were: (i) awareness that midwives educated at a higher education level can deliver higher-quality health care, (ii) women are motivated to seek care from well-educated midwives, (iii) the planned programme is attractive and (iv) the university has a stable academic administration and established collaborations. Hindering factors were: (i) Students\u2019 lack of prerequisites for study; (ii) objections to educating midwives at a higher education level; (iii) inadequate teaching resources; and (iv) inadequate working conditions for midwives. Conclusion: The facilitating factors strengthen the belief that it is possible to implement this midwifery education programme, while the hindering factors need to be addressed to run the programme successfully. The findings can guide higher education institutions starting similar midwifery education programmes in the DRC and elsewhere, although it is crucial to conduct a context study in those specific contexts.", "keywords": "Context, Democratic Republic of Congo, Implementation science, Low-income nation, Midwifery education programme, Qualitative study, Sub-Saharan Africa", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166656874"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.nepr.2023.103720"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "118440356", "scopus-affilname": "Evangelical University in Africa", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bukavu", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Congo"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Marie", "first_name": "Berg", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7202002907"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60033091", "scopus-affilname": "H\u00f6gskolan i Bor\u00e5s", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Boras", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Ewa Carlsson", "first_name": "Lalloo", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58522177500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "118440356", "scopus-affilname": "Evangelical University in Africa", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bukavu", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Congo"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Fatuma Kilongo", "first_name": "Ngongo", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58521662900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Malin", "first_name": "Bogren", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-2432-8097"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55177319000"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
