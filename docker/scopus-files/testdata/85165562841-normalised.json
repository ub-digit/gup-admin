In this paper, the claims by degrowth scholars on the limits of decoupling growth and carbon emissions are critically examined by assessing the economic and climate consequences of their claims. It is claimed that their pessimistic view on decoupling is not based on robust arguments but rather mystifications of what decoupling is. Following the assumptions by leading degrowth scholars \u2013 that decoupling (decrease of the emission intensity of GDP) are unlikely to be larger than 4% and that levels of GDP need to converge in a degrowing world \u2013 indicates that the 1.5 \u00b0C target is ruled out altogether and that in order to reach the 2 \u00b0C target, the economies of the global north would have to be reduced with over 90% and for middle income countries with around 70%. This appears as very unlikely to happen. Yet, there might be alternatives, which are discussed by sketching a realist and dynamic theory of decoupling.", "keywords": "Climate change, Climate realism, Decoupling, Degrowth, Economic growth, Steady state", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165562841"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.ecolecon.2023.107937"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
