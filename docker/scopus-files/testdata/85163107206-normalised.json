Integrating drone technology has emerged as an innovative approach to address these challenges and revolutionize healthcare delivery. Drones can significantly enhance response times, increase access to underserved areas, and reduce the burden on existing medical infrastructure. A detailed analysis of global case studies demonstrates the successful use of drones in healthcare delivery, emphasizing the importance of regulatory frameworks and public\u2013private partnerships. These examples provide valuable insights into Saudi Arabia\u2019s health sector transformation. The potential benefits of integrating drone technology include improved patient outcomes, increased efficiency, and cost savings. To ensure the successful implementation of this transformative approach, it is crucial to establish clear regulatory guidelines, invest in research and development, and foster collaboration between the government, private sector, and healthcare stakeholders. The aim of this study is to explore the potential of drone technology in transforming healthcare delivery in Saudi Arabia, particularly within disaster response and prehospital care services.", "keywords": "disaster response, drone technology, emergency medical services, health sector, prehospital care, UAV", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163107206"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/healthcare11111575"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
