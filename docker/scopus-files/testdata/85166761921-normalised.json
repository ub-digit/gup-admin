We used linear mixed models to determine if baseline or rate of yearly change in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of MMP-2; MMP-3; MMP-10; TIMP-123 (composite of TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3); or TIMP-4 predicted changes in bilateral entorhinal cortex thickness, hippocampal volume, or lateral ventricle volume in cognitively unimpaired individuals. We also assessed effects on the CSF AD biomarkers amyloid-\u03b242 and phosphorylated tau181. Low baseline levels of MMP-3 predicted larger ventricle volumes and more entorhinal cortex thinning. Increased CSF MMP-2 levels over time predicted more entorhinal thinning, hippocampal atrophy, and ventricular expansion, while increased TIMP-123 over time predicted ventricular expansion. No MMP/TIMPs predicted changes in CSF AD biomarkers. Notably, we show for the first time that longitudinal increases in MMP-2 and TIMP-123 levels may predict age-associated brain atrophy. In conclusion, MMPs and TIMPs may play a role in brain atrophy in cognitively unimpaired aging.", "keywords": "Cerebrospinal fluid, Cognitively unimpaired older adults, Magnetic resonance imaging, Matrix metalloproteinases, Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166761921"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2023.05.012"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
