Methods: The study included 2010 patients with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery and 2037 matched controls, eligible for surgery. The surgery group underwent gastric bypass (n = 265), banding (n = 376), or vertical banded gastroplasty (n = 1369). The control group (n = 2037) received usual obesity care. Causes of death were obtained from the Swedish Cause of Death Register, case sheets and autopsy reports, in patients with baseline T2D (n = 392 surgery patients/n = 305 controls) or non-T2D (n = 1609 surgery patients/n = 1726 controls) during a median follow-up 26 years. Results: In T2D and non-T2D subgroups, bariatric surgery was associated with increased life expectancy (2.1, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.2\u20134.0; and 1.6, 0.5\u20132.7 years, respectively) and reduced overall mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (adjHR) = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.61\u20130.97; and 0.82, 0.72\u20130.94, respectively), and the treatment benefit was similar (interaction p = 0.615). Bariatric surgery was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in both subgroups (adjHR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.46\u20130.91; and 0.70, 0.55\u20130.88, respectively (interaction p = 0.516)). Conclusions: Bariatric surgery is associated with similar reduction of overall and cardiovascular mortality and increased life expectancy regardless of baseline diabetes status.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164560288"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1038/s41366-023-01332-2"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
