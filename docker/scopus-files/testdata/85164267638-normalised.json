Assays for analysis of NFL in plasma are now widely available but plasma NFL has not been reported in iNPH patients. Our aim was to examine plasma NFL in iNPH patients and to evaluate the correlation between plasma and CSF levels, and whether NFL levels are associated with clinical symptoms and outcome after shunt surgery. METHODS: Fifty iNPH patients with median age 73 who had their symptoms assessed with the iNPH scale and plasma and CSF NFL sampled pre- and median 9\u00a0months post-operatively. CSF plasma was compared with 50 healthy controls (HC) matched for age and gender. Concentrations of NFL were determined in plasma using an in-house Simoa method and in CSF using a commercially available ELISA method. RESULTS: Plasma NFL was elevated in patients with iNPH compared to HC (iNPH: 45 (30-64) pg/mL; HC: 33 (26-50) (median; Q1-Q3), p\u2009=\u20090.029). Plasma and CSF NFL concentrations correlated in iNPH patients both pre- and postoperatively (r\u2009=\u20090.67 and 0.72, p\u2009<\u20090.001). We found only weak correlations between plasma or CSF NFL and clinical symptoms and no associations with outcome. A postoperative NFL increase was seen in CSF but not in plasma. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma NFL is increased in iNPH patients and concentrations correlate with CSF NFL implying that plasma NFL can be used to assess evidence of axonal degeneration in iNPH. This finding opens a window for plasma samples to be used in future studies of other biomarkers in iNPH. NFL is probably not a very useful marker of symptomatology or for prediction of outcome in iNPH.", "keywords": "Biomarkers, CSF, Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, Neurofilament light chain protein, NFL, Plasma", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164267638"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s12987-023-00455-y"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
