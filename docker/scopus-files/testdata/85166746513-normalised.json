While supported by the majority of Swedes, this approach faced rapid and continuous criticism. Unfortunately, the respectful debate centered around scientific evidence often gave way to mudslinging. However, the available data on excess all-cause mortality rates indicate that Sweden experienced fewer deaths per population unit during the pandemic (2020\u20132022) than most high-income countries and was comparable to neighboring Nordic countries through the pandemic. An open, objective scientific dialogue is essential for learning and preparing for future outbreaks.", "keywords": "COVID-19, excess mortality, health policy, lockdown, SARS-CoV-2, scientific dialogue, Sweden", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166746513"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3389/fpubh.2023.1206732"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
