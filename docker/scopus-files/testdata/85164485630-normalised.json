In this post hoc analysis from the SHIFT trial, we analysed the treatment effects of ivabradine in HF patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP)\u00a0<\u00a0110\u00a0mmHg, resting heart rate (RHR)\u00a0\u2265\u00a075\u00a0b.p.m., left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)\u00a0\u2264\u00a025%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III/IV, and their combination. Methods and results: The SHIFT trial enrolled 6505 patients (LVEF\u00a0\u2264\u00a035% and RHR\u00a0\u2265\u00a070\u00a0b.p.m.), randomized to ivabradine or placebo on the background of guideline-defined standard care. Compared with placebo, ivabradine was associated with a similar relative risk reduction of the primary endpoint (cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization) in patients with SBP\u00a0<\u00a0110 and \u2265110\u00a0mmHg [hazard ratio (HR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74\u20131.08 vs. HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72\u20130.89, P interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.34], LVEF\u00a0\u2264\u00a025% and >25% (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72\u20131.01 vs. HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71\u20130.90, P interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.53), and NYHA III\u2013IV and II (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74\u20130.94 vs. HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69\u20130.94, P interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.79). The effect was more pronounced in patients with RHR\u00a0\u2265\u00a075 compared with <75 (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.68\u20130.85 vs. HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81\u20130.1.16, P interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.02). When combining these profiling parameters, treatment with ivabradine was also associated with risk reductions comparable with patients with low-risk profiles for the primary endpoint (relative risk reduction 29%), cardiovascular death (11%), HF death (49%), and HF hospitalization (38%; all P values for interaction: 0.40). No safety concerns were observed between study groups. Conclusions: Our analysis shows that RHR reduction with ivabradine is effective and improves clinical outcomes in HF patients across various risk indicators such as low SBP, high RHR, low LVEF, and high NYHA class to a similar extent and without safety concern.", "keywords": "Heart failure, Heart rate, High risk, Ivabradine, Risk indicators", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164485630"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1002/ehf2.14455"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
