The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether image quality and the risk for misdiagnosis is affected by using defective transducers. Methods: Four defective transducers with varying degrees of defect severity, still in clinical use, were selected. Forty artifact-affected clinical images from each transducer were compared with images acquired from fully functional transducers, of the same model, in an observer study where four experienced radiologists rated each of the 320 images. The rating tasks included if the artifacts were detectable, if the possible artifacts might affect the diagnosis, how well structural details were reproduced and, finally, an assessment of overall image quality. Results: The artifacts in the images were detectable for three of the four transducers (p < 0.05), and in 121 of 640 assessments of the images from the defective transducers the observers were confident that the artifacts could affect the diagnosis. All four faulty transducers were assessed to have decreased ability to resolve structural details (p < 0.05), and three of the four transducers were assessed to have worse overall image quality (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The present study shows that image quality and the risk of misdiagnosis can be affected by using defective transducers. This highlights the importance of frequent quality control of the transducers to avoid decreased image quality and even misdiagnosis.", "keywords": "Defective transducer, Image quality", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163437093"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2023.06.004"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
