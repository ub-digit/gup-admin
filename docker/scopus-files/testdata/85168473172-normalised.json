Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing and is associated with adverse outcomes for both mother and child. The metabolic demands of pregnancy can reveal a predisposition for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and women with a history of GDM are more likely to develop T2DM than women with normoglycemic pregnancies. Aim. The aim of this study was to explore midwives' and diabetes nurses' experience of their role in screening, care, and follow-up of women with gestational diabetes mellitus and, further, to explore their opinions and thoughts about existing routines and guidelines. Method. Individual interviews were performed with ten diabetes nurses and eight midwives working in primary and special care. Qualitative content analysis was done according to Graneheim and Lundman. Results. The analysis of the interviews resulted in the overall theme \"An act of balance between normalcy and illness, working for motivation with dilemmas throughout the chain of health care.\"Difficulties in carrying out the important task of handling GDM while at the same time keeping the pregnancy in focus were central. Women were described as highly motivated to maintain a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy with the baby in mind, but it seemed difficult to maintain this after delivery, and compliance with long-term follow-up with the aim of reducing the risk of T2DM was low. The women came to the first follow-up but did not continue with later contact. This was at a time when the women felt healthy and were focusing on the baby and not themselves. A lack of cooperation and easy access to a dietician and physiotherapist were pointed out as well as a wish for resources such as group activities and multiprofessional teams.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168473172"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1155/2023/6386581"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031040", "scopus-affilname": "Ume\u00e5 Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Umea", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Sofia", "first_name": "K\u00f6ps\u00e9n", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-0820-6946"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57215083276"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031040", "scopus-affilname": "Ume\u00e5 Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Umea", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Mikael", "first_name": "Lilja", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "24168648300"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "122626070", "scopus-affilname": "Skaraborg Institute", "scopus-affiliation-city": null, "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Margareta", "first_name": "Hellgren", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "14422380600"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031040", "scopus-affilname": "Ume\u00e5 Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Umea", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Jonas", "first_name": "Sandlund", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "12139865300"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031040", "scopus-affilname": "Ume\u00e5 Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Umea", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Rita", "first_name": "Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "24741381100"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
