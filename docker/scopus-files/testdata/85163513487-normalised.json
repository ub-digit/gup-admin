A competitor backs another competitor to support their transportation and logistics activities for mutual benefit and growth over several echelons. On that note, there is a need for a solid horizontal collaboration framework within the supply chain network to ease the collaboration between transportation logistics and supply chain planning. This study has integrated a systematic review of past literature and a bibliometric analysis of the acquired data set. Most relevant keywords were used in the keyword search covering all the major databases. From the final data set, various insights on how collaborative supply chain and transportation network design, profit\u2010sharing, inventory bundling, and distribution, vehicle routing, and transport planning should be designed to attain optimal horizontal collaboration. The findings also portray the future research prospects on horizontal collaboration, practical research gaps, and related enablers within supply chain planning with a conceptual framework.", "keywords": "Horizontal collaboration, Logistics planning, Supply chain digitalization, Supply chain planning, Transportation planning", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163513487"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.joitmc.2023.100066"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
