A deeper understanding of factors that influence their ability to be physically active is essential to identify individuals in need of support. The aim was to explore factors that influence adult childhood cancer survivor\u2019s ability to be physically active. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted from June to October 2020 with 20 adult childhood cancer survivors with a median age of 31 (min\u2013max 20\u201347) years. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed with qualitative content analysis. Results: Four main categories: \u201cThe impact of environmental factors,\u201d \u201cPersonal factors of importance,\u201d \u201cConsequences of the treatment or disease,\u201d and \u201cThe impact of support from healthcare\u201d and 10 sub-categories, were identified. Participants described how family habits and encouragement from others influenced their present ability to be physically active. Experienced benefits of physical activity were described as a facilitator for current physical activity while suffering from late complications was identified as a barrier. Participants highlighted the importance of specific and individualized physical activity recommendations. Conclusion: This study includes adult childhood cancer survivors several years after completion of treatment, hence highlighting the importance for support both during treatment and follow-up to sustain their physical activity. Healthcare providers need to identify individuals suffering from late complications, even several years after treatment; provide individualized physical activity recommendations; and educate families and schools about the importance of physical activity in childhood cancer survivorship.
