Our aim was twofold. First, we aimed to describe and analyse how the participants talk about their treatment and its side-effects in relation to the body and masculinity. Second, we aimed to describe the participants\u2019 understanding of and motivation to participate in a physical activity programme designed by healthcare professionals to deal with anticipated and unwanted bodily changes following treatment. Focus group interviews and individual interviews were conducted. Theoretically, the study leans on phenomenological theories of embodiment combined with a sociologically informed framework found in critical studies on men and masculinity. The results showed that the medical suspension of testosterone impacted not only the men\u2019s understanding of themselves as men but also how they approached their own bodies. Testosterone was discussed as a source of masculinity and masculine traits. Consequently, the absence of testosterone following treatment led to ongoing reflections on how to understand the (ageing) body and its relationship to masculinity. The ageing ADT body, with growing breasts and a lack of libido, became a site of emasculation and bodily detachment. The men addressed this by displaying stoic masculinity; instead of addressing the problem emotionally they turned their attention and aspirations to having a capable body and being able to carry out physical work. However, participation in the exercise programme depended on recruitment by their physicians and was motivated by the opportunity to socialise with other men in the same situation.", "keywords": "body, exercise programme, masculinity, physical activity, prostate cancer", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166437971"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/socsci12070417"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60108011", "scopus-affilname": "Linnaeus University, V\u00e4xj\u00f6", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Vaxjo", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Cecilia", "first_name": "Rindhagen", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0009-0003-5916-1191"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58516858300"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60108011", "scopus-affilname": "Linnaeus University, V\u00e4xj\u00f6", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Vaxjo", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Jesper", "first_name": "Andreasson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-1631-6475"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55820474900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Thomas", "first_name": "Johansson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-2047-4943"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "35492537200"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
