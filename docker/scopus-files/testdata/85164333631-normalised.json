This article identifies the historical roots of this consensus and assesses it as an undesirable development. After this point of departure, and through empirical research with children conducted in Portugal, the article offers constructive insights into how accessibility planning might be rescued from the technocratic rule both in substantive and processual terms. These insights entail two key dimensions. The first concerns how children would shape the urban environments they inhabit to move away from car-based mobility and toward child-friendly accessibilities. The second concerns how children\u2019s voices can be integrated into accessibility planning practices so that the prevailing technocratic context can be challenged. The insights gathered are promising, even though future steps should be carefully considered so that children\u2019s abilities to navigate both in urban and participatory environments can be gradually cultivated despite the highly protective cultural norms en vogue.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164333631"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/02513625.2023.2229627"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
