This study investigates the effect of different fertilizers and plant growth regulator on the growth and morphology of chili seedlings. Soil application of NPK, urea, SOP, and DAP (2.5 g/L) was applied during sowing, and N in two splits at sowing and after twenty days of sowing while foliar application of GA3 (50 mg/L) was applied after fifteen days of germination. The result of five seedlings' traits plant height (PH), plant girth (PG), plant spread (PS), number of leaves (NOF), and root length (RL) demonstrated a significant difference among growth-related traits in chili seedlings owing to the use of fertilizers, GA3, and their combinations. An optimum level of K and P alone or in combination with GA3 had a significant effect on all traits. PH was particularly influenced by the combination of GA3 with K and P whereas other traits like PG, NOF, PS, and RL are greatly influenced by the application of NPK, urea, SOP, DAP, and their combination with GA3. The study results showed an increase in chili seedlings' growth and morphology in response to various fertilizers and GA3.", "keywords": "Chili seedlings, Fertilizers, Gibberellin, Growth, Morphology", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162931310"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.chnaes.2023.06.003"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
