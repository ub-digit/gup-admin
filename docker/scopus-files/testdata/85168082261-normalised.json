We investigated the use of ALBC and SAP in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Patients and methods \u2014 This observational study is based on 2,971,357 primary TKAs reported in 2010\u20132020 to national/regional joint arthroplasty registries in Australia, Den-mark, Finland, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. Aggregate-level data on trends and types of bone cement, antibiotic agents, and doses and duration of SAP used was extracted from participating registries. Results \u2014 ALBC was used in 77% of the TKAs with variation ranging from 100% in Norway to 31% in the USA. Palacos R+G was the most common (62%) ALBC type used. The primary antibiotic used in ALBC was gentamicin (94%). Use of ALBC in combination with SAP was common practice (77%). Cefazolin was the most common (32%) SAP agent. The doses and duration of SAP used varied from one single preoperative dosage as standard practice in Bolzano, Italy (98%) to 1-day 4 doses in Norway (83% of the 40,709 TKAs reported to the Norwegian arthroplasty register). Conclusion \u2014 The proportion of ALBC usage in primary TKA varies internationally, with gentamicin being the most common antibiotic. ALBC in combination with SAP was common practice, with cefazolin the most common SAP agent. The type of ALBC and type, dose, and duration of SAP varied among participating countries.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168082261"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.2340/17453674.2023.17737"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
