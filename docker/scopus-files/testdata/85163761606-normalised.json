Methods: This was a single institution, case\u2013control study of 170 patients status-post ACL-R (2010\u20132019) separated into two matched groups (sex, age, BMI, graft type). Group 1\u2014symptomatic, operative meniscus tears (both de novo and recurrent) after ACL-R. Group 2\u2014no postoperative meniscus tears. Femoral and tibial tunnel positions were measured by 2 authors via lateral knee radiographs that were used to measure two ratios (a/t and b/h). Ratio a/t was defined as distance from the tunnel center to dorsal most subchondral contour of the lateral femoral condyle (a) divided by total sagittal diameter of the lateral condyle along Blumensaat\u2019s line (t). The ratio b/h was defined as distance between the tunnel and Blumensaat\u2019s line (b) divided by maximum intercondylar notch height (h). Wilcoxon sign-ranks paired test was used to compare measurements between groups (alpha set at p < 0.05). Results: Group 1 had average follow up of 45\u00a0months and Group 2 had average follow up of 22\u00a0months. There were no significant demographic differences between Groups 1 and 2. Group 1\u2014a/t was 32.0% (\u00b1 10.2), which was significantly more anterior than group 2, 29.3% (\u00b1 7.3; p < 0.05). There was no difference in average femoral tunnel ratio b/h or tibial tunnel placement between groups. Conclusions: A relationship exists between more anterior/less anatomic femoral tunnel position and the presence of recurrent or de novo, operative meniscus tears after ACL-R. Surgeons performing ACL-R should strive for recreation of native anatomy via proper tunnel placement to maximize postoperative outcomes.
