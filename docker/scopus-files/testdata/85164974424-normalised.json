PTB is a complex disease with multiple risk factors including genetic variation. Much research has aimed to establish the biological mechanisms underlying PTB often through identification of genetic markers for PTB risk. The objective of this review is to present a comprehensive and updated summary of the published data relating to the field of PTB genetics. A literature search in PubMed was conducted and English studies related to PTB genetics were included. Genetic studies have identified genes within inflammatory, immunological, tissue remodeling, endocrine, metabolic, and vascular pathways that may be involved in PTB. However, a substantial proportion of published data have been largely inconclusive and multiple studies had limited power to detect associations. On the contrary, a few large hypothesis-free approaches have identified and replicated multiple novel variants associated with PTB in different cohorts. Overall, attempts to predict PTB using single \u201c-omics\u201d datasets including genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic biomarkers have been mostly unsuccessful and have failed to translate to the clinical setting. Integration of data from multiple \u201c-omics\u201d datasets has yielded the most promising results.", "keywords": "Epigenetics, Genomics, Gestational duration, Multiple \u201c-omics\u201d analyses, Preterm birth, Transcriptomics", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164974424"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s43032-023-01287-9"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
