This study aimed to evaluate feasibility of CRC screening using a qualitative fecal immunochemical test (FIT) among Iranian average-risk adults. METHODS: In this feasibility study, 7039 individuals aged 50-75 years were invited by community health workers (CHWs) in southern Tehran and its suburban districts between April 2018 and November 2019. The CHWs performed a qualitative FIT with cut-off level 50 ng Hb/mL buffer and referred those with positive-FIT for colonoscopy to the endoscopy center of Shariati hospital in Tehran. Outcomes included acceptance rate, FIT positivity rate, colonoscopy compliance, detection rates and positive predictive values (PPVs) with 95% confidence interval for CRC and advanced adenomas (AAs). RESULTS: Acceptance rate at initial invitation was 71.7%. From 4974 average-risk adults (1600 males and 3374 females) who were offered FIT, 96.8% (n=4813) provided valid samples, of whom 471 (9.8%) tested positive. Among FIT-positive participants, 150 (31.8%) underwent colonoscopy; CRC was detected in 2.0% (n=3) and adenomas in 27.3% (n=41). Detection rate of CRC and AAs per 1000-FIT-screened participants was 0.6 (0.1-1.8) [males: 0.7 (0.01-3.6), females: 0.6 (0.07-2.0)] and 4.2 (2.5-6.4) [males: 5.9 (2.6-11.0), females: 3.4 (1.7-6.0)], respectively. PPVs were 2.0% (0.4-5.7) for CRC and 13.3% (8.3-19.8) for AAs. There was no association between gender and the studied outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our results partially support the feasibility of scaling up organized CRC-screening through the existing healthcare system in Iran; it remains to be discussed carefully to ensure the capacity of healthcare system for adequate colonoscopy services.", "keywords": "Colorectal cancer, Feasibility studies, Screening", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166777197"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.34172/aim.2023.22"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
