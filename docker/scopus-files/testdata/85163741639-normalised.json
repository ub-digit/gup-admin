Although the formation of amyloid plaques in human brains is suggested to be a key factor in initiating AD pathogenesis, it is still not fully understood the upstream events that lead to A\u03b2 plaque formation and its metabolism inside the brains. Methods: Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) has been successfully introduced to study AD pathology in brain tissue both in AD mouse models and human samples. By using MALDI-MSI, a highly selective deposition of A\u03b2 peptides in AD brains with a variety of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) involvement was observed. Results: MALDI-MSI visualized depositions of shorter peptides in AD brains; A\u03b21-36 to A\u03b21-39 were quite similarly distributed with A\u03b21-40 as a vascular pattern, and deposition of A\u03b21-42 and A\u03b21-43 was visualized with a distinct senile plaque pattern distributed in parenchyma. Moreover, how MALDI-MSI covered in situ lipidomics of plaque pathology has been reviewed, which is of interest as aberrations in neuronal lipid biochemistry have been implicated in AD pathogenesis. Discussion: In this study, we introduce the methodological concepts and challenges of MALDI-MSI for the studies of AD pathogenesis. Diverse A\u03b2 isoforms including various C- and N-terminal truncations in AD and CAA brain tissues will be visualized. Despite the close relationship between vascular and plaque A\u03b2 deposition, the current strategy will define cross talk between neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular processes at the level of A\u03b2 metabolism.", "keywords": "Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-beta, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, gangliosides, lipids, mass spectrometry imaging, proteoform, sphingolipids, sulfatides", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163741639"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1089/brain.2022.0057"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
