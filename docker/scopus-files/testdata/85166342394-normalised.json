Methods: An overnight polysomnography (PSG) was conducted in patients with CTEPH, who were eligible for pulmonary endarterectomy. Pulmonary hemodynamics (mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) measured with right heart catheterization (RHC)), PSG variables (apnea\u2013hypopnea index (AHI)), lung function and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) values, as well as demographics and comorbidities were entered into a logistic regression model to address the determinants of severe NH (nocturnal oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) < 90% under >20% of total sleep time (TST)). SRBDs were defined as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA; as an AHI \u2265 15 events/h), central sleep apnea with Cheyne\u2013Stokes respiration (CSA\u2013CSR; CSR pattern \u2265 50% of TST), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), and isolated sleep-related hypoxemia (ISRH; SpO2 < 88% under >5 min without OSA, CSA, or OHS). Results: In all, 50 consecutive patients (34 men and 16 women; mean age 54.0 (SD 15.1) years) were included. The average mPAP was 43.8 (SD 16.8) mmHg. SRBD was observed in 40 (80%) patients, of whom 27 had OSA, 2 CSA\u2013CSR, and 11 ISRH. None had OHS. Severe NH was observed in 31 (62%) patients. Among the variables tested, age (odds ratio (OR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01\u20131.15; p = 0.031), mPAP (OR 1.11 [95% CI 1.02\u20131.12; p = 0.012]), and AHI (OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.02\u20131.35; p = 0.031]) were independent determinants of severe NH. Conclusions: Severe NH is highly prevalent in patients with CTEPH. Early screening for SRBDs and intervention with nocturnal supplemental oxygen and/or positive airway pressure as well as pulmonary endarterectomy may reduce adverse outcomes in patients with CTEPH.", "keywords": "CTEPH, nocturnal hypoxemia, pulmonary endarterectomy, pulmonary hypertension, sleep-related breathing disorders", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166342394"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/jcm12144639"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60004502", "scopus-affilname": "Marmara \u00dcniversitesi Tip Fak\u00fcltesi", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Istanbul", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Turkey"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Caner", "first_name": "\u00c7\u0131nar", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55886772700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60004502", "scopus-affilname": "Marmara \u00dcniversitesi Tip Fak\u00fcltesi", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Istanbul", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Turkey"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "\u015eehnaz Olgun", "first_name": "Y\u0131ld\u0131zeli", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-3236-3995"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57188962674"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60006369", "scopus-affilname": "Ko\u00e7 \u00dcniversitesi", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Istanbul", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Turkey"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Baran", "first_name": "Balcan", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56703376200"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60004502", "scopus-affilname": "Marmara \u00dcniversitesi Tip Fak\u00fcltesi", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Istanbul", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Turkey"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Bedrettin", "first_name": "Y\u0131ld\u0131zeli", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6603589108"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60004502", "scopus-affilname": "Marmara \u00dcniversitesi Tip Fak\u00fcltesi", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Istanbul", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Turkey"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "B\u00fclent", "first_name": "Mutlu", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "8944973300"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016774", "scopus-affilname": "Medicinska Fakulteten", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60006369", "scopus-affilname": "Ko\u00e7 \u00dcniversitesi", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Istanbul", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Turkey"}, {"scopus-afid": "60002746", "scopus-affilname": "Harvard Medical School", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Boston", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}, {"scopus-afid": "60001361", "scopus-affilname": "University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Pittsburgh", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Y\u00fcksel", "first_name": "Peker", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-9067-6538"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6603831207"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
