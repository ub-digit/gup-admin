The clinical relevance of NMDAR antibodies outside the context of encephalitis was assessed in this study. METHODS: Plasma from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) (N=108) and healthy control subjects (N=89) was screened at baseline for immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgM, and IgG NMDAR antibodies, phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181), and the neuroaxonal injury marker neurofilament light (NfL). Clinical assessment of the patients included measures of cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Non-Motor Symptoms Scale for Parkinson's Disease). A subgroup of patients (N=61) was followed annually for up to 6 years. RESULTS: Ten (9%) patients with PD tested positive for NMDAR antibodies (IgA, N=5; IgM, N=6; IgG, N=0), and three (3%) healthy control subjects had IgM NMDAR antibodies; IgA NMDAR antibodies were detected significantly more commonly among patients with PD than healthy control subjects (\u03c72=4.23, df=1, p=0.04). Age, gender, and disease duration were not associated with NMDAR antibody positivity. Longitudinally, antibody-positive patients had significantly greater decline in annual MMSE scores when the analyses were adjusted for education, age, disease duration, p-tau181, NfL, and follow-up duration (adjusted R2=0.26, p=0.01). Neuropsychiatric symptoms were not associated with antibody status, and no associations were seen between NMDAR antibodies and p-tau181 or NfL levels. CONCLUSIONS: NMDAR antibodies were associated with greater cognitive impairment over time in patients with PD, independent of other pathological biomarkers, suggesting a potential contribution of these antibodies to cognitive decline in PD.", "keywords": "Immunology (Neuropsychiatric Aspects), Parkinson\u2019s Disease", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164846481"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1176/appi.neuropsych.20220107"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
