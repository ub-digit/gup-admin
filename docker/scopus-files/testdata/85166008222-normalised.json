In this study we investigate the N partitioning in ecosystem compartments of a grassland heath, and the impact of multiple climate change factors on long-term N retention after 15N pulse labelling. The impacts of elevated carbon dioxide (eCO2), warming and drought and the treatments in combination on ecosystem N retention were investigated in a field scale manipulation experiment. A 6-year time-course was assessed by pulse-labelling with the stable N isotope 15N and by sampling after 1 day, 1 year and 6 years. After 6 years we observed that the total ecosystem retained 42% of the amended 15N across treatments (recovery of the amended 15N in the pool). The fate of the applied 15N was mainly stabilization in soil, with 36% 15N recovery in soil, while the plant compartment and microbial biomass each retained only 1%\u20132% of the added 15N. This suggests a moderate retention of N, for all treatments, as compared to similar long-term studies of forest ecosystems. A decreased ammonium and vegetation N pool combined with higher 15N retention in the soil under eCO2 treatments suggests that eCO2 promoted processes that immobilize N in soil, while warming counteracted this when combined with eCO2. Drought treatments contrastingly increased the vegetation N pool. We conclude that as the organic soil layer has the main capacity for N storage in a temperate heathland-grassland, it is important for buffering nutrient availability and maintaining a resilient ecosystem. However, the full treatment combination of drought, warming and eCO2 did not differ in 15N recovery from the control, suggesting unchanged long-term consequences of climate change on retention of pulse added N in this ecosystem.", "keywords": "15 N recovery, Calluna vulgaris, climate change, microbial biomass, nitrogen cycling, soil organic matter", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166008222"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/ejss.13397"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
