In the present study, communication between children and teacher(s) in play is consider as a form educational discourse mediating language learning. The study, informed by a sociocultural perspective aims to contribute to the knowledge of pattern of establishing a pedagogical dialogue in play activities. What characterizes the communication establishing a joint play in which children come to participate in extensive dialogues is clarified through reanalyzing video-documented data from a project concerning play, learning and teaching in ECEC. The analysis implies a pattern of ICE: children initiating a play (I)\u2014a teacher challenging the initiative (C)\u2014children expanding the content (E). The function of challenging is understood as the critical contribution for opening for and expanding the children\u2019s verbal participation. A conclusion of changing the follow-up from evaluating to expanding in a pedagogical dialogue is recommended to study further in different contexts.", "keywords": "dialogical teaching, early childhood education, IRF, learning, playresponsive teaching", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165245769"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/1476718X231185436"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
