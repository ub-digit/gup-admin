Material and methods: Searches were made among randomized controlled trials evaluating clinical aspects and the changes in marginal bone level before and after surgical treatment of peri-implantitis, with and without bone substitute. Results: Nine published articles and 442 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. Reconstructive techniques exhibited a greater extent of defect fill than conventional surgical techniques alone. No significant differences could be found for clinical measures of peri-implant disease (bleeding on probing and reduction of probing depth) from baseline to the 12-month follow-up. Conclusions: With regards to the clinical measures of disease, our review shows that there are no differences between open flap debridement and regenerative surgery. From an esthetic standpoint, it may however be that regenerative measures may lead to improvement but further publications with this focus will be necessary to verify this.", "keywords": "osseous defects, Peri-implantitis, reconstructive, reconstructive surgery, reconstructive therapy, reconstructive treatment", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166926159"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/00016357.2023.2243325"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60011180", "scopus-affilname": "Odontologiska Institutionen i J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Jonkoping", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Massimo", "first_name": "Risolo", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58525572000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "100436732", "scopus-affilname": "N\u00c4L Hospital", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Trollhattan", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "H\u00fclya", "first_name": "Cevik-Aras", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "15052948200"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60009358", "scopus-affilname": "Link\u00f6pings Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Linkoping", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "100331740", "scopus-affilname": "Specialist Ctr. for Oral Rehab.", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Linkoping", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Shariel", "first_name": "Sayardoust", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6506778257"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
