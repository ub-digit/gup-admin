Accelerated aging has been found in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), but its validation against markers of neurodegeneration and AD is lacking. Here, imaging-derived measures from the UK Biobank dataset (N=22,661) were used to predict brain-age in 2,314 cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals at higher risk of AD and mild cognitive impaired (MCI) patients from four independent cohorts with available biomarker data: ALFA+, ADNI, EPAD and OASIS. Brain-age delta was associated with abnormal amyloid-\u03b2, more advanced stages (AT) of AD pathology and APOE-\u03b54 status. Brain age delta was positively associated with plasma neurofilament light, a marker of neurodegeneration, and sex differences in the brain effects of this marker were found. These results validate brain-age delta as a non-invasive marker of biological brain aging in non-demented individuals with abnormal levels of biomarkers of AD and axonal injury.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162933801"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.7554/eLife.81067"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
