From the perspective of neurodiversity studies and translation practice/studies, the article negotiates new perspectives of inherited images of neurological selves and others, such as the non-autistic as the 'typical' in contrast to the 'atypical' autistic person. Experimenting with autistic time, allowing different sensory modalities and different approaches to time, detail and narrative, the article challenges deficit approaches to autism. Through a letter writing practice the possibilities and challenges of subjectivity, cultural translation and writing as method are examined. The article suggests that 'counter narratives' are important sources of knowledge as they reclaim personhood from dehumanising perspectives. By performing neuromixed conversation and dialogue with theoretical concepts, and pen paling as play as a fruitful form for responsible cross-neurotype translation, the article illuminates challenges and opportunities in neurodiverse collective writing.", "keywords": "creative writing, literature and medicine, Medical humanities, poetry and prose", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168806299"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1136/medhum-2022-012384"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60021136", "scopus-affilname": "S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Huddinge", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Hanna", "first_name": "Bertilsdotter Rosqvist", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-7257-0956"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55091116700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60005288", "scopus-affilname": "HDK-Valand \u2013 H\u00f6gskolan f\u00f6r Konst och Design", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Elisabeth", "first_name": "Hjorth", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57224158092"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60005288", "scopus-affilname": "HDK-Valand \u2013 H\u00f6gskolan f\u00f6r Konst och Design", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Anna", "first_name": "Nygren", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58220552000"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
