However, because research on language stigmatizing schizophrenia has focused on paper-based media, its results have limited generalizability to contemporary media. Also, research on interventions to guide media professionals in accurately depicting schizophrenia has been scarce. The present study had two aims: (1) to assess how print, web, and radio/TV news media in Sweden portray schizophrenia and (2) to evaluate a campaign targeting media professionals' responses to information about schizophrenia and the consequences of stigmatizing language. Study Design: Using data from Retriever's database, considering media types and topics, the terms \"schizophrenia\"and \"schizophrenic\"were examined in the past 20 years, whereas analyses of stigmatizing reporting of these terms used media from the past 10 years. Media professionals' responses and actions in the anti-stigma information campaign StigmaWatch were also evaluated. Study Results: Between 2002 and 2022, \"schizophrenia\"was mentioned 34 141 times in the dataset and \"schizophrenic\"10 058 times. However, no trends were statistically significant. All media topics and most types of media contained stigmatizing reporting. Of the 230 media professionals who received informative emails from StigmaWatch, 77 (33%) responded. Most responses were supportive, and 14% of the professionals reported taking corrective measures (eg, revising erroneous descriptions of schizophrenia) following the email. Conclusions: No media topic was free of language stigmatizing schizophrenia. The anti-stigma information campaign seemed to have been effective, for most media professionals who responded were supportive, and a sizable proportion reported taking corrective measures.", "keywords": "intervention, media, schizophrenia, severe mental illness, stereotyping, stigma", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168383272"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1093/schizbullopen/sgad018"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
