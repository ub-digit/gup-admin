A large part of the cost of wind energy is due to the cost of maintaining wind power equipment. When a wind turbine component fails to function, it might need to be replaced under circumstances that are less than ideal. This is known as corrective maintenance. To minimize unnecessary costs, a more active maintenance policy based on the life expectancy of the key components is preferred. Optimal scheduling of preventive maintenance activities requires advanced mathematical modeling. In this paper, an optimal preventive maintenance algorithm is designed using the renewal-reward theorem. In the multi-component setting, our approach involves a new idea of virtual maintenance that allows us to treat each replacement event as a renewal event even if some components are not replaced by new ones. The proposed optimization algorithm is applied to a four-component model of a wind turbine, and the optimal maintenance plans are computed for various initial conditions. The modeling results clearly show the benefit of PM planning compared to a pure CM strategy (about 30% lower maintenance cost).", "keywords": "algorithm design, combinatorial optimization, linear programming, preventive maintenance, renewal-reward theorem, virtual maintenance, Weibull distribution, wind turbine", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165984874"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/a16070334"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016575", "scopus-affilname": "Ericsson Sweden", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Quanjiang", "first_name": "Yu", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-3620-4959"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57219694709"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60000990", "scopus-affilname": "Chalmers University of Technology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Ola", "first_name": "Carlson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-7441-0147"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7005685754"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60000990", "scopus-affilname": "Chalmers University of Technology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Serik", "first_name": "Sagitov", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-4577-8188"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7004500467"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
