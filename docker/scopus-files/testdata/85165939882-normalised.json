This analysis investigated which factors contributed to improved well-being and treatment satisfaction with CGM. Methods: The GOLD trial was a randomized crossover trial comparing CGM versus self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) over 16 months. Endpoints included well-being measured by the World Health Organization\u2013Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and treatment satisfaction by the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) as well as glucose metrics. Multivariable R2-decomposition was used to understand which variables contributed most to treatment satisfaction. Results: A total of 139 participants were included. Multivariable analyses revealed that increased convenience and flexibility contributed to 60% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 50%-69%) of the improvement in treatment satisfaction (Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire change version [DTSQc]) observed with CGM, whereas perceived effects on hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia only contributed to 6% (95% CI = 2%-11%) of improvements. Significant improvements in well-being (WHO-5) by CGM were observed for the following: feeling cheerful (P =.025), calm and relaxed (P =.024), being active (P =.046), and waking up fresh and rested (P =.044). HbA1c reductions and increased time in range (TIR) were associated with increased treatment satisfaction, whereas glycemic variability was not. HbA1c reduction showed also an association with increased well-being and increased TIR with less diabetes-related distress. Conclusions: While CGM improves glucose control in people with T1D on MDI, increased convenience and flexibility through CGM is of even greater importance for treatment satisfaction and patient well-being. These CGM-mediated effects should be taken into account when considering CGM initiation.", "keywords": "CGMS, MDI, quality of life, SMBG, treatment satisfaction, type 1 diabetes", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165939882"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/19322968231183974"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
