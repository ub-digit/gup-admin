However, the small sample size and relatively few events limited the statistical power of the study. We therefore pooled data from the prospective HILUS trial with retrospective data from patients in the Nordic countries treated outside the prospective study to evaluate toxicity and risk factors for high-grade toxic effects. Methods and Materials: All patients were treated with 56 Gy in 8 fractions. Tumors within 2 cm of the trachea, the mainstem bronchi, the intermediate bronchus, or the lobar bronchi were included. The primary endpoint was toxicity, and the secondary endpoints were local control and overall survival. Clinical and dosimetric risk factors were analyzed for treatment-related fatal toxicity in univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses. Results: Of 230 patients evaluated, grade 5 toxicity developed in 30 patients (13%), of whom 20 patients had fatal bronchopulmonary bleeding. The multivariable analysis revealed tumor compression of the tracheobronchial tree and maximum dose to the mainstem or intermediate bronchus as significant risk factors for grade 5 bleeding and grade 5 toxicity. The 3-year local control and overall survival rates were 84% (95% CI, 80%-90%) and 40% (95% CI, 34%-47%), respectively. Conclusions: Tumor compression of the tracheobronchial tree and high maximum dose to the mainstem or intermediate bronchus increase the risk of fatal toxicity after stereotactic body radiation therapy in 8 fractions for central lung tumors. Similar dose constraints should be applied to the intermediate bronchus as to the mainstem bronchi.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166571260"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.ijrobp.2023.06.246"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
