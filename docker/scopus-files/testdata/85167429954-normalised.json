Few studies have compared the effects of the MedDiet in early Alzheimer's disease or compared the effects of the diet within and outside of the Mediterranean region. The Mediterranean diet adherence screener (MEDAS) and MEDAS continuous scores were calculated at the baseline visit of the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia Longitudinal Cohort Study (n = 1625). The scores were included in linear regression models to test for associations with hippocampal volume, log-transformed white matter lesion volume, cerebrospinal fluid pTau18, and A\u03b242. Higher MEDAS scores were associated with lower log-transformed white matter lesion volume (\u03b2: \u22120.07, standard error [SE]: 0.02, p < 0.001). This association was only seen in the Mediterranean region (\u03b2: \u22120.12, SE: 0.03, p < 0.001). In the non-Mediterranean region, higher MEDAS continuous scores were associated with lower cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b242 (\u03b2: \u221268.30, SE: 14.32, p < 0.001). More research is needed to understand the differences in the associations seen with the MedDiet and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in different European regions.", "keywords": "Alzheimer's, Biomarkers, Cohort study, Mediterranean diet, Risk factors", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167429954"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2023.07.012"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
