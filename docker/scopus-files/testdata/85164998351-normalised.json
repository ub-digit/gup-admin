Thus, improved disease-specific biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring treatment efficacy are of paramount importance. Specific non-reducing end GAG structures (GAG-NREs) have become promising biomarkers for MPS, as the compositions of the GAG-NREs depend on the nature of the lysosomal enzyme deficiency, thereby creating a specific pattern for each subgroup. However, there is yet no straightforward clinical laboratory platform which can assay all MPS-related GAG-NREs in one single analysis. Here, we developed and applied a GAG domain mapping approach for analyses of urine samples of ten MPS patients with various MPS diagnoses and corresponding aged-matched controls. We describe a nano-LC\u2013MS/MS method of GAG-NRE profiling, utilizing 2-aminobenzamide reductive amination labeling to improve the sensitivity and the chromatographic resolution. Diagnostic urinary GAG-NREs were identified for MPS types IH/IS, II, IIIc, IVa and VI, corroborating GAG-NRE as biomarkers for these known enzyme deficiencies. Furthermore, a significant reduction of diagnostic urinary GAG-NREs in MPS IH (n = 2) and MPS VI (n = 1) patients under treatment was demonstrated. We argue that this straightforward glycomic workflow, designed for the clinical analysis of MPS-related GAG-NREs in one single analysis, will be of value for expanding the use of GAG-NREs as biomarkers for MPS diagnosis and treatment monitoring.", "keywords": "Biomarkers, GAG-non-reducing ends, Glycomic, Glycosaminoglycans, Mucopolysaccharidosis", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164998351"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s10719-023-10128-5"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
