Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25(OH)D concentration < 50 nmol/L) among women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Thus, 265 women scheduled for IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) between September 2020 and August 2021 at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden, were included. Data on serum 25(OH)D concentration, vitamin D intake, and sun exposure were collected via questionnaires and blood samples. Approximately 27% of the women had 25(OH)D insufficiency, which was associated with longer infertility duration. The likelihood of insufficiency was higher among women from non-Nordic European countries (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.03\u20138.26, adjusted p = 0.043), the Middle East (OR 9.90, 95% CI 3.32\u201329.41, adjusted p < 0.001), and Asia (OR 5.49, 95% CI 1.30\u201323.25, adjusted p = 0.020) than among women from Nordic countries. Women who did not use vitamin D supplements were more likely to have insufficiency compared with supplement users (OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.55\u20137.10, adjusted p = 0.002), and those who avoided sun exposure had higher odds of insufficiency compared to those who stayed \u201cin the sun all the time\u201d (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.22\u20138.62, adjusted p = 0.018). Women with infertility in northern latitudes and those from non-Nordic countries who avoid sun exposure and do not take vitamin supplements have a higher prevalence of 25(OH)D insufficiency and longer infertility duration.", "keywords": "25-hydroxyvitamin D, dietary assessment, in vitro fertilization, infertility, sun exposure, vitamin D insufficiency", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164006963"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/nu15122820"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
