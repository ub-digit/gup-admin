Design/Setting: Data on all births at 22 and 23 weeks' gestational age (GA) were prospectively collected in 2004-2007 (T1) or obtained from national registers in 2014-2016 (T2) and 2017-2019 (T3). Infants were assigned perinatal activity scores based on 3 key obstetric and 4 neonatal interventions. Main outcome: One-year survival and survival without major neonatal morbidities (MNM): intraventricular haemorrhage grade 3-4, cystic periventricular leucomalacia, surgical necrotising enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity stage 3-5 or severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The association of GA-specific perinatal activity score and 1-year survival was also determined. Results: 977 infants (567 live births and 410 stillbirths) were included: 323 born in T1, 347 in T2 and 307 in T3. Among live-born infants, survival at 22 weeks was 5/49 (10%) in T1 and rose significantly to 29/74 (39%) in T2 and 31/80 (39%) in T3. Survival was not significantly different between epochs at 23 weeks (53%, 61% and 67%). Among survivors, the proportions without MNM in T1, T2 and T3 were 20%, 17% and 19% for 22 weeks and 17%, 25% and 25% for 23 weeks' infants (p>0.05 for all comparisons). Each 5-point increment in GA-specific perinatal activity score increased the odds for survival in first 12 hours of life (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.4; 95% CI 1.3 to 1.6) in addition to 1-year survival (aOR 1.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3), and among live-born infants it was associated with increased survival without MNM (aOR 1.3; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4). Conclusion: Increased perinatal activity was associated with reduced mortality and increased chances of survival without MNM in infants born at 22 and 23 weeks of GA.", "keywords": "neonatology, paediatrics", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164396139"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1136/archdischild-2022-325164"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
