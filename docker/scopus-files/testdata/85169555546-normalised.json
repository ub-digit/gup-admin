The MCs are instead found between the glomerular capillaries, embedded in their mesangial matrix. They are in direct contact with the endothelial cells and in close contact with the podocytes and together they form the glomerulus. The MCs can produce and react to a multitude of growth factors, cytokines, and other signaling molecules and are in the perfect position to be a central hub for crosstalk communication between the cells in the glomerulus. In certain glomerular diseases, for example, in diabetic kidney disease or IgA nephropathy, the MCs become activated resulting in mesangial expansion. The expansion is normally due to matrix expansion in combination with either proliferation or hypertrophy. With time, this expansion can lead to fibrosis and decreased glomerular function. In addition, signs of complement activation are often seen in biopsies from patients with glomerular disease affecting the mesangium. This review aims to give a better understanding of the MCs in health and disease and their role in glomerular crosstalk and inflammation.", "keywords": "complement, cross-talk, diabetic kidney disease, glomerulus, IgA nephropathy, mesangial cell, Mesangium", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169555546"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/apha.14045"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Roberto", "first_name": "Boi", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-9474-7620"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57204398505"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Kerstin", "first_name": "Ebefors", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "14065943400"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Jenny", "first_name": "Nystr\u00f6m", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-2615-8389"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "14056491200"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
