Our aims were to investigate [1] the relationships between maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) during pregnancy and the child\u2019s body mass index (BMI) and risk of overweight at 5 years of age, and [2] maternal pre-pregnancy BMI as effect modifier for these associations. Methods: Data sources included a subsample from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa sub-cohort; N = 2,744) and the Swedish GraviD cohort study (N = 891). Maternal 25OHD was analyzed in gestational week 18 in the MoBa sub-cohort and week 10 in the GraviD cohort. In the MoBa sub-cohort, parents reported their child\u2019s documented measures of weight and length or height from the health card at routine check-up. In the GraviD cohort, this information was collected directly from medical records. Childhood overweight (including obesity) was identified using the International Obesity Task Force cut-offs. Linear and logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between maternal 25OHD and child\u2019s BMI and risk of overweight at 5 years of age in each cohort separately, and in a pooled dataset. Results: In the pooled analysis, maternal 25OHD <30 nmol/L was associated with lower BMI in children at 5 years of age, but not with risk of overweight. Interaction analysis showed that the association was predominant among children of mothers with pre-pregnancy BMI \u226525 kg/m2. Conclusion: Low maternal vitamin D status, particularly in mothers with overweight or obesity, predicted lower BMI in their five-year-old children. However, there was no evidence of an effect on overweight in these children.", "keywords": "25-hydroxyvitamin D, childhood BMI, childhood overweight, MoBa, observational study, pregnancy, vitamin D", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167517658"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3389/fnut.2023.1201171"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Anna", "first_name": "Amberntsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57202436049"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Linnea", "first_name": "B\u00e4rebring", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56971440600"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Anna", "first_name": "Winkvist", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7003934607"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Lauren", "first_name": "Lissner", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7007179284"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60011916", "scopus-affilname": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Oslo", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Helle Margrete", "first_name": "Meltzer", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7202446947"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60011916", "scopus-affilname": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Oslo", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Anne Lise", "first_name": "Brants\u00e6ter", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "16644672100"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60011916", "scopus-affilname": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Oslo", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "Eleni", "first_name": "Papadopoulou", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58484774600"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "8", "last_name": "Hanna", "first_name": "Augustin", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56511473100"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
