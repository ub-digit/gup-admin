However, the initial cellular biocompatibility, molecular activity, and the release of functionalized molecules from these novel surfaces require extensive investigation for clinical use. Aiming to develop and compare innovative surfaces for application in dental implants, the present study utilized titanium disks, which were treated and divided into four groups: machined (Macro); acid-etched (Micro); anodized-hydrophilic surface (TNTs); and anodized surface coated with a rifampicin-loaded polymeric layer (poly(lactide-co-glycolide), PLGA) (TNTsRIMP). The samples were characterized regarding their physicochemical properties and the cumulative release of rifampicin (RIMP), investigated at different pH values. Additionally, differentiated osteoblasts from mesenchymal cells were used for cell viability and qRT-PCR analysis. Antibacterial properties of each surface treatment were investigated against Staphylococcus epidermidis. TNTsRIMP demonstrated controlled drug release for up to 7 days in neutral pH environments. Osteogenic cell cultures indicated that all the evaluated surfaces showed biocompatibility. The TNTs group revealed up-regulated values for bone-related gene quantification in 7 days, followed by the TNTsRIMP group. Furthermore, the antibiotic-functionalized surface revealed effectiveness to inhibit S. epidermidis and stimulate promising conditions for osteogenic cell behavior. Characteristics such as nanomorphology and hydrophilicity were determinants for the up-regulated quantification of osteogenic biomarkers related to early bone maturation, encouraging application in intra-osseous implant surfaces; in addition, antibiotic-functionalized surfaces demonstrated significant higher antibacterial properties compared to the other groups. Our findings suggest that polymeric-antibiotic-loaded coating might be applied for the prevention of early infections, favoring its application in multifunctional surfaces for intra- and/or trans-mucosal components of dental implants, while, hydrophilic nanotextured surfaces promoted optimistic properties to stimulate early bone-related cell responses, favoring its application in bone-anchored surfaces.", "keywords": "Dental implants, Drug-delivery, Drug-release, Multifunctional surfaces, Nanotechnology, Osseointegration", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163153649"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.colsurfb.2023.113417"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
