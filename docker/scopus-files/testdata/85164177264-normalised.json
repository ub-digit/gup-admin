Furthermore, we analysed whether differential risk for TTEs exists in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) versus type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study. SETTING: The December 2020 version of the Cerner Real-World Data COVID-19 database is a deidentified, nationwide database containing electronic medical record (EMR) data from 87 US-based health systems. PARTICIPANTS: We analysed EMR data for 322\u2009482 patients >17 years old with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who received care between December 2019 and mid-September 2020. Of these, 2750 had T1DM; 57\u2009811 had T2DM; and 261\u2009921 did not have diabetes. OUTCOME: TTE, defined as presence of a diagnosis code for myocardial infarction, thrombotic stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis or other TTE. RESULTS: Odds of TTE were substantially higher in patients with T1DM (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.23 (1.93-2.59)) and T2DM (AOR 1.52 (1.46-1.58)) versus no diabetes. Among patients with diabetes, odds of TTE were lower in T2DM versus T1DM (AOR 0.84 (0.72-0.98)). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of TTE during COVID-19 illness is substantially higher in patients with diabetes. Further, risk for TTEs is higher in those with T1DM versus T2DM. Confirmation of increased diabetes-associated clotting risk in future studies may warrant incorporation of diabetes status into SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment algorithms.", "keywords": "COVID-19, DIABETES &amp; ENDOCRINOLOGY, Health informatics, Stroke, Thromboembolism", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164177264"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1136/bmjopen-2022-071475"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
