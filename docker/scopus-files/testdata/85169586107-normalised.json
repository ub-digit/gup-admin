Interviewees articulate a simplified distinction between singlehood in Europe and singlehood in Bangladesh or Syria. Singlehood has been theorized as wavering between a period of waiting and a lifestyle with its own inherent value. In our sample, while Bangladeshis describe bachelorhood as a period of waiting, distancing themselves from what they see as European singlehood, Syrians tend to embrace singlehood as inherently valuable and prefer a \u2018European way\u2019 of being single. We argue that this difference between the groups is connected not primarily to national or regional cultures, but to how racialized borders shape the two groups in Europe, as well as to the role of class positionalities in determining attitudes toward singlehood.", "keywords": "Bangladeshi, borderwork, migration, Singlehood, Syrians", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169586107"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/18902138.2023.2251351"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60002392", "scopus-affilname": "Karlstads Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Karlstad", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Andreas", "first_name": "Henriksson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-1067-3906"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57194543056"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60002392", "scopus-affilname": "Karlstads Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Karlstad", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Ulf", "first_name": "Mellstr\u00f6m", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-7235-0179"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6506738214"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "105497587", "scopus-affilname": "University of Fulda", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Fulda", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Germany"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Andrea", "first_name": "Priori", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-1318-6137"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57207975622"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Katarzyna", "first_name": "Wojnicka", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-5175-7105"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56451032900"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
