The pair amplitudes provide a complete description of translation-invariant and rotation-invariant states in the lowest Landau level (LLL), both compressible and incompressible. To leading nontrivial order beyond the non-interacting high-temperature limit, they are determined analytically in terms of the Haldane pseudopotential parameters Vm, which provides a qualitative description of the crossover towards incompressible ground states for different filling factors. Moreover, we show that for contact interactions \u223c g2\u03b4(2)(x), which are scale invariant at the classical level, the non-commutativity of the guiding center coordinates gives rise to a quantum anomaly in the commutator i[HbLLL, DbR] = (2 +\u2113\u2202\u2113)HbLLL with the dilatation operator DbR in the LLL, which replaces the trace anomaly in the absence of a magnetic field. The interaction-induced breaking of scale invariance gives rise to a finite frequency shift of the breathing mode in a harmonic trap, which describes transitions between different Landau levels, the strength of which is estimated in terms of the relevant dimensionless coupling constant ge2", "keywords": "Bose\u2013Einstein condensates under rapid rotation, Lowest Landau Level, Scale invariance and quantum scale anomaly, Universal/exact (Tan) relations, Virial Expansion", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165195876"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.5802/crphys.137"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
