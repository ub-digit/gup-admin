By combining an electron-electron coincidence technique with the use of soft X-radiation we have measured a double ionisation spectrum of the allene molecule in which one electron is removed from a C1s core orbital and one from a valence orbital, well beyond Siegbahns Electron-Spectroscopy-for-Chemical-Analysis method. This core-valence double ionisation spectrum shows the effect of symmetry breaking in an extraordinary way, when the core electron is ejected from one of the two outer carbon atoms. To explain the spectrum we present a new theoretical approach combining the benefits of a full self-consistent field approach with those of perturbation methods and multi-configurational techniques, thus establishing a powerful tool to reveal molecular orbital symmetry breaking on such an organic molecule, going beyond L\u00f6wdins standard definition of electron correlation.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163928721"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1038/s42004-023-00934-1"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
