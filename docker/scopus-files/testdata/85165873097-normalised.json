Still, preclinical research has primarily been conducted in males. More research is thus required to define the effects displayed by nicotine on the female brain. To this end, female rats received 15 injections of either nicotine (0.36mg/kg) or saline, over a 3-week period and were then followed for up to 3 months. Behavioral effects of nicotine were assessed using locomotor activity measurements and elevated plus maze, while neurophysiological changes were monitored using ex vivo electrophysiological field potential recordings conducted in subregions of the dorsal and ventral striatum. Behavioral assessments demonstrated a robust sensitization to the locomotor stimulatory properties of nicotine, but monitored behaviors on the elevated plus maze were not affected during acute (24\u00a0h) or protracted (3 months) withdrawal. Electrophysiological recordings revealed a selective increase in excitatory neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens shell and dorsomedial striatum during acute withdrawal. Importantly, accumbal neuroadaptations in nicotine-treated rats correlated with locomotor behavior, supporting a role for the nucleus accumbens in behavioral sensitization. While no sustained neuroadaptations were observed following 3 months withdrawal, there was an overall trend towards reduced inhibitory tone. Together, these findings suggest that nicotine produces selective transformations of striatal brain circuits that may drive specific behaviors associated with nicotine exposure. Furthermore, our observations suggest that sex-specificity should be considered when evaluating long-term effects by nicotine on the brain.", "keywords": "Electrophysiology, Elevated plus maze, Nicotine, Nucleus accumbens, Withdrawal", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165873097"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s00702-023-02678-7"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Oona", "first_name": "Lagstr\u00f6m", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57203268482"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Edvin", "first_name": "Vestin", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57201472542"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Bo", "first_name": "S\u00f6derpalm", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7005043686"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Mia", "first_name": "Ericson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7101845686"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Louise", "first_name": "Adermark", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-7165-9908"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "15057555400"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
