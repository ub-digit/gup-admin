The mutual interest in creating long-Term records of environmental change was rekindled during workshops in Magadan (2018), Tomsk (2018) and Southampton (2019). These events were organised to connect researchers from the UK and SRFE with these aims: (1) provide training in new techniques and methods, (2) facilitate knowledge transfer about local sites and conditions, (3) stimulate large-scale collaborative projects across SRFE and (4) inspire a new generation of palaeoenvironmental researchers.", "keywords": "International Network, Science Diplomacy, Scientific Collaboration", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163182208"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1017/S0032247423000116"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
