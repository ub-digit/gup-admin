Perspectives on Democratic Backsliding", "pubyear": "2023", "sourcetitle": "International Studies Review", "issn": "15219488", "eissn": null, "sourcevolume": "25", "sourceissue": "2", "sourcepages": null, "articlenumber": "viad019", "abstract": "There is a widespread perception that we are witnessing a period of democratic decline, manifesting itself in varieties of democratic backsliding such as the manipulation of elections, marginalization and repression of regime opponents and minorities, or more incremental executive aggrandizement. Yet others are more optimistic and have argued that democracy is in fact resilient, or that we are observing coinciding trends of democratic decline but also expansion. This forum highlights key issues in the debate on democracy's decline, which center on conceptual and measurement issues, agreement on the phenomenon but not its nature or severity, the importance of international factors, the emphasis we should put on political elites versus citizens, and the consequences of backsliding for global politics. Staffan I. Lindberg provides an empirical perspective on the scope and severity of democracy's decline, and argues that polarization and misinformation are important drivers for this current wave of autocratization. Susan D. Hyde highlights the detrimental consequences of reduced support for democracy by the international community, which has affected civil society organizations - important arbiters of democracy - especially severely. Challenging some of these conclusions, Irfan Nooruddin claims that any gains for democracy after the end of the Cold War were short-lived, failing to sustain democracy because of an overemphasis on elections and a disregard for structural factors. Finally, Larry M. Bartels argues that we need to look to political elites and not citizens if we want to protect democracy in the United States and elsewhere, which has important implications for how we study democracy and its challenges.", "keywords": "autocratization, democracy, democratic backsliding, international democracy promotion", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164133552"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1093/isr/viad019"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
