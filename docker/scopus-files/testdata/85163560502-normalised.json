Drawing upon intersectionality, we analyse how gender equality is presented, discussed and negotiated in relation to ethnicity and nationality in Sweden. Methodologically, we employ a bifocal lens that combines (1) a quantitative investigation of representations of civic orientation programmes in Swedish policy documents and mainstream media, and (2) a qualitative analysis of ethnographic data collected in six civic orientation courses\u2013three in English and three in Arabic\u2013in three large municipalities. Such a two-pronged approach, which connects policy and media discourses with interactions in civic orientation classes, offers a granular picture of the complex and often ambivalent intersections of ethnicity and gender in relation to migration in Sweden. Ultimately, the co-optation of feminist values brings with it the risk of warping feminism into a trait of national/ethnic distinctiveness. Crucially, femonationalism is not the prerogative of far-right parties but is already becoming institutionalised, informing both mainstream media and educational practices in a feminist state like Sweden.", "keywords": "femonationalism, Intersectionality, migration, state feminism, Sweden", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163560502"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/17405904.2023.2228933"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
