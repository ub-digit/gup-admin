Conversely, educational practices and experiences offer fertile ground for research into language learning, teaching and assessment. This book views research in language education as a reciprocal venture that should benefit all participants equally. Practice is shaped by theory, which in turn is illuminated and refined by practice. The book brings together studies from different fields of language education in nine countries on four continents: Cameroon, Canada, Finland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan and Sweden. The authors report on research that depends on the active involvement of teachers, teacher educators and learners of different ages and various backgrounds. The book focuses on projects designed to address challenges in the classroom and on the role of learners as collaborative agents in the research process as well as collaborative research in professional development and the role of collaborative research in the development of national policy.", "keywords": "Agency, Collaboration, Educational research, Reciprocity", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166055350"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1515/9783110787719"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Gudrun", "first_name": "Erickson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "15029941500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60028378", "scopus-affilname": "Stockholms universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Camilla", "first_name": "Bardel", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "24337180500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60011149", "scopus-affilname": "Trinity College Dublin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Dublin", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Ireland"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "David", "first_name": "Little", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56111203100"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
