There is no scientific evidence on whether the surgeon's sex affects the patient-reported outcome after orthopaedic surgery such as total hip arthroplasty (THA). We therefore aimed to investigate the association between surgeon sex and health-related quality of life after THA.Methods:Data on primary THAs performed between 2008 and 2016 were collected from 10 hospitals in western Sweden. The data were linked with the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register, a regional patient register and the National Board of Health and Welfare, resulting in a data set that included surgeon-related and patient-related data. The outcome of the study was the change in health-related quality of life, measured with the 3-level version of EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L) Index and EQ-visual analog scale (VAS), before and 1-year after THA. Mixed models, using hierarchical linear regression adjusted for patient sex, age, preoperative health-related quality of life and Charnley classification, were fitted to estimate the gain in EQ-5D-3L Index and EQ-VAS with 95% confidence intervals based on surgeon sex.Results:In total, 8,383 primary THAs were done for osteoarthritis by 193 surgeons. Of those, 37 were women and 156 were men. The regression model was showed that patients operated by female surgeons had a \u03b2-coefficient of gain in EQ-5D-3L Index of -0.001 (-0.022 to 0.021) and a \u03b2-coefficient of gain in EQ VAS of 0.004 (-0.023 to 0.030), compared with patients operated by male surgeons. Similar results were obtained in a sensitivity analysis including attendings only.Discussion:Patients undergoing primary THA reported similar gain in health-related quality of life regardless of surgeon sex. Based on our results, health-related quality of life after primary THA was not associated with the sex of the operating surgeon.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163448129"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.5435/JAAOS-D-22-00840"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
