However, the influence of this type of innovation support on business model innovation remains poorly understood. This paper explores the potential for municipal influence on sustainable business model innovation by analysing work conducted within four municipal open innovation platforms. The results indicate that influence falls into two separate categories. First, influence can be direct, involving the stipulation of desirable business model archetypes and the provision of resources, or indirect, such as the arrangement of meetings between clients. Second, influence can be formal, including official statements on business models or innovation, or informal, involving interactions outside of the platform and the use of unofficial information material. Established actors were attracted by direct and formal support but also had power to influence the platforms. Platform staff would identify and assess those clients who sought informal and indirect support and, if desirable, introduce them to other types of innovation support. The study highlights the need to consider the complexities of balancing local administrative, political, and business interests when designing and staffing open innovation platforms.", "keywords": "Innovation platforms, Municipal innovation support, Sustainable business model innovation, Sustainable development", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163145945"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.cities.2023.104455"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
