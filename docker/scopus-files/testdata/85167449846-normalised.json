In this study, we aimed to evaluate the influence of mechanical surface treatments, such as polishing, grinding, and sandblasting, on the residual stress of 3\u20136YSZ used for monolithic prostheses in association with crystalline phase transformation. Plate specimens were prepared from five dental zirconia blocks: Aadva Zirconia ST (3YSZ), Aadva Zirconia NT (6YSZ), Katana HT (4YSZ), Katana STML (5YSZ), and Katana UTML (6YSZ). The specimens were either polished using 1, 3, or 9 \u03bcm diamond suspensions, ground using 15, 35, or 55 \u03bcm diamond discs, or sandblasted at 0.2, 0.3, or 0.4 MPa. The residual stress, crystalline phase, and hardness were analyzed using the cos\u03b1 method, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Vickers hardness test, respectively. Additionally, we analyzed the residual stress on the surfaces of monolithic zirconia crowns (MZCs) made of 4YSZ, 5YSZ, and 6YSZ, which were processed using clinically relevant procedures, including manual grinding, followed by polishing using a dental electric motor on the external surface, and sandblasting on the internal surface. Residual stress analysis demonstrated that grinding and sandblasting, particularly the latter, resulted in the generation of compressive residual stress on the surfaces of the plate specimens. XRD revealed that the ground and sandblasted specimens contained a larger amount of the rhombohedral phase than that of the polished specimens, which may be a cause of the residual stress. Sandblasting significantly increased the Vickers hardness compared to polishing, which may possibly be due to the generation of compressive residual stress. In the case of MZCs, compressive residual stress was detected not only on the sandblasted surface, but also on the polished surface. The difference in the residual stress between the plate and crown specimens may be related to the force applied during the automated and manual grinding and polishing procedures. Further studies are required to elucidate the effects of the compressive residual stress on the clinical performance of MZCs.", "keywords": "Crystalline structure, Mechanical surface treatment, Monolithic zirconia, Residual stress, Vickers hardness", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167449846"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.jmbbm.2023.106067"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60008435", "scopus-affilname": "Tohoku University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Sendai", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Japan"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Shunichi", "first_name": "Shishido", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-5655-4294"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57203566788"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60008435", "scopus-affilname": "Tohoku University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Sendai", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Japan"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Ryoichi", "first_name": "Inagaki", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "23473485400"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60008435", "scopus-affilname": "Tohoku University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Sendai", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Japan"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Taro", "first_name": "Kanno", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7201750760"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Per", "first_name": "Svanborg", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-4698-3092"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6602508503"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Sargon", "first_name": "Barkarmo", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-9733-0927"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55326655700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Ulf", "first_name": "\u00d6rtengren", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6602909134"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60008435", "scopus-affilname": "Tohoku University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Sendai", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Japan"}], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "Keisuke", "first_name": "Nakamura", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-6368-2569"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55807315100"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
