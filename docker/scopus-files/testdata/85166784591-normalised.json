For 20\u2009years, Swedish obstetricians have followed a weighted-risk algorithm guideline for risk estimation, based on which patient selection, timing, duration and dosage of thromboprophylaxis are determined. This article presents the latest update, the basis for the algorithm and its application for assessing moderate- to high obstetric VTE risk, defined as equal or greater absolute risk per time unit than the antepartum risk of women with one prior VTE. The risk score is based on risk factors conferring approximately fivefold increased risk of VTE or a multiple thereof. This article also presents algorithm efficacy data and describes lifestyle advice provided to patients. In our experience, the Swedish guideline for obstetric VTE risk estimation is easy to follow. It helps identify women at high risk. The risk of under- or overtreatment is thus minimised.", "keywords": "guidelines, lifestyle, obstetric thromboprophylaxis, Pregnancy, thromboembolism", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166784591"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/01443615.2023.2241527"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
