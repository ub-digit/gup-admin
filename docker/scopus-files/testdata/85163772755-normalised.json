We aimed to develop an ecologically sustainable 3D printed bioactive hydrogel-based topical wound dressing targeting healing of hard-to-heal wounds, such as chronic or burn wounds, which are low on exudate. To this end, we developed a formulation composed of renewable marine components; purified extract from unfertilized salmon roe (heat-treated X, HTX), alginate from brown seaweed, and nanocellulose from tunicates. HTX is believed to facilitate the wound healing process. The components were successfully formulated into a 3D printable ink that was used to create a hydrogel lattice structure. The 3D printed hydrogel showed a HTX release profile enhancing pro-collagen I alpha 1 production in cell culture with potential of promoting wound closure rates. The dressing has recently been tested on burn wounds in G\u00f6ttingen minipigs and shows accelerated wound closure and reduced inflammation. This paper describes the dressings development, mechanical properties, bioactivity, and safety.", "keywords": "3D printed scaffolds, alginate, biomaterial, hard-to-heal wounds, nanocellulose, salmon roe, wound dressing", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163772755"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/polym15122627"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
