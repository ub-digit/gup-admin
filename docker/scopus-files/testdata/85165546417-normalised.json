The presence of AD pathology is associated with worse outcomes after a shunt procedure in iNPH. Preoperative diagnosis of AD is challenging in patients with iNPH, which involves reduced concentrations of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to estimate the effect size of iNPH as a factor in CSF levels of AD biomarkers and to test if correction could be used to improve diagnostic value. METHODS: Our cohort included 222 iNPH patients with data in the Kuopio NPH registry and brain biopsy and CSF samples available. We divided the patients into groups according to AD pathology per brain biopsy. For control cohorts, we had CSF samples from cognitively healthy individuals (n\u200a=\u200a33) and patients with diagnosed AD and no iNPH (n\u200a=\u200a39).*-31ptResults:Levels of all investigated biomarkers differed significantly between groups, with the exception of t-Tau levels between healthy individuals and iNPH patients with AD pathology. Applying a correction factor for each biomarker (0.842*A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a042, 0.779*t-Tau, and 0.610*P-Tau181) for the effect of iNPH yielded a sensitivity of 2.4% and specificity of 100%. The ratio of P-Tau181 to A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a042 was moderately effective in aiding recognition of AD pathology in iNPH patients (sensitivity 0.79, specificity 0.76, area under the curve 0.824). CONCLUSION: Correcting for iNPH as a factor failed to improve diagnostic effectiveness, but the P-Tau181/A\u03b21\u00a0-\u00a042 ratio showed some utility in the diagnosis of AD in iNPH patients.", "keywords": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease, brain, cerebrospinal fluid, needle biopsy, normal pressure hydrocephalus", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165546417"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3233/JAD-230144"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
