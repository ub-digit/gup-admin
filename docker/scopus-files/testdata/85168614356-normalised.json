However, there are no studies that compare AECOPD admissions with admissions for respiratory infections, including COVID-19. This study aimed to examine hospital admission rates for AECOPD, pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 among COPD patients, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients and Methods: We obtained anonymized data on hospital admissions of patients with COPD and a primary diagnosis code for AECOPD, pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19, from the hospital patient admission register at a large Swedish hospital. The study compared the pandemic period (February 2020\u2013March 2022) to a period before the pandemic (June 2017\u2013January 2020). Sequential phases of the pandemic were evaluated separately. Monthly admission rates were compared using Poisson regression, controlling for admission month. Results: Comparing monthly admission rates during the pandemic with the prepandemic period, incidence rate ratios were 0.72 for AECOPD (95% CI 0.67\u20130.77; p<0.001), 0.56 for pneumonia (95% CI 0.49\u20130.62; p<0.001), 0.18 for influenza during the winter period (95% CI 0.10\u20130.30; p<0.001) and 0.79 for total COPD admissions, including COVID-19 (95% CI 0.75\u20130.84; p<0.001). The study showed significantly lower rate ratios for AECOPD, pneumonia, and total COPD admissions during the first, second, third, and fifth (Omicron) waves. No significant effect on admissions was seen after the withdrawal of restriction measures. Conclusion: There was a significant reduction in the overall rate of hospital admissions among COPD patients for AECOPD, pneumonia, and respiratory viral infections during the pandemic despite the rise in COVID-19 admissions. However, prepandemic admission levels returned in the post-restriction period.", "keywords": "acute exacerbation of COPD, COPD, COVID-19, epidemiology, influenza virus, respiratory viruses", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168614356"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.2147/COPD.S409452"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Niklas", "first_name": "Andreen", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57536312300"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Johan", "first_name": "Westin", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7005136305"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Lowie E.G.W.", "first_name": "Vanfleteren", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "26028693900"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
