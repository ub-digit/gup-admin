Amyloid-\u03b2 is produced by APP, a gene located on chromosome 21. People who have Down syndrome have three copies of chromosome 21 and thus also an additional copy of APP; this genetic change drives the early development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in these individuals. Methods: Here we use a combination of next-generation mouse models of Down syndrome (Tc1, Dp3Tyb Dp(10)2Yey and Dp(17)3Yey) and a knockin mouse model of amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation (AppNL-F) to determine how chromosome 21 genes other than APP modulate APP/amyloid-\u03b2 in the brain when in three copies. Results: We demonstrate that three copies of other chromosome 21 genes are sufficient to partially ameliorate amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation in the brain. We go on to identify a subregion of chromosome 21 that contains the gene/genes causing this decrease in amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation and investigate the role of two lead candidate genes Dyrk1a and Bace2. Conclusion: Thus an additional copy of chromosome 21 genes, other than APP, can modulate APP/amyloid-\u03b2 in the brain under physiological conditions. This work provides critical mechanistic insight into the development of disease and an explanation for the typically later age of onset of dementia in people who have AD-DS compared to those who have familial AD caused by triplication of APP.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163405648"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1002/alz.063898"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
