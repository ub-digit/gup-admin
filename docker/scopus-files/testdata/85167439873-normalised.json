Measuring deviations from the results of Furry-picture perturbation theory in SFQED at high \u03a7 can be valuable for testing the existing predictions, as well as for guiding further theoretical developments. Nevertheless, such experimental measurements are challenging due to the probabilistic nature of the interaction processes, dominating signals of low-\u03a7 interactions and limited capabilities to control and measure the alignment and synchronization in such collision experiments. Here we elaborate a methodology of using approximate Bayesian computations (ABC) for drawing statistical inferences based on the results of many repeated experiments despite partially unknown collision parameters that vary between experiments. As a proof-of-principle, we consider the problem of inferring the effective mass change due to coupling with the strong-field environment.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167439873"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1017/hpl.2023.64"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
