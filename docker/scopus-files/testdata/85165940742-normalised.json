Thus, a thorough understanding of enamel composition is essential to develop novel strategies for dental enamel repair. While the mineral found in bone and dental enamel is generally viewed as the biologically-produced equivalent of hydroxy(l)apatite, the formation of these bioapatites is controlled by different organic matrix frameworks-mainly type-I collagen in bone and amelogenin in enamel. In lower vertebrates, such as rodents, two distinct types of enamel are produced. Iron-containing pigmented enamel protects the continuously growing incisor teeth while magnesium-rich unpigmented enamel covers the molar teeth. Using high-resolution Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, this work explores the differences in acid phosphate (HPO42-), carbonate (CO32-), hydroxyl (OH-), iron, and magnesium content of pigmented incisor enamel and unpigmented molar enamel of Sprague Dawley rats. Bundles of hydroxy(l)apatite nanowires comprise the enamel prisms, where prisms in pigmented enamel are wider and longer than those in unpigmented molars. In contrast to magnesium-rich unpigmented enamel, higher mineral crystallinity, and higher HPO42- and OH- levels are hallmark features of iron-rich pigmented enamel. Furthermore, the apparent absence of iron oxides or oxy(hydroxides) indicates that iron is introduced into the apatite lattice at the expense of calcium, albeit in amounts that do not alter the Raman signatures of the PO43- internal modes. Compositional idiosyncrasies of iron-rich pigmented and nominally iron-free unpigmented enamel offer new insights into enamel biomineralisation supporting the notion that, in rodents, ameloblast function differs significantly between the incisors and the molars.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165940742"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1038/s41598-023-38792-5"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
