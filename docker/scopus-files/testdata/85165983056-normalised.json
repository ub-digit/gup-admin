The proof embeds ID^1i into the corresponding theory over Beeson\u2019s logic of partial terms and then uses two consecutive interpretations, a realizability interpretation of this theory into the subtheory generated by almost negative fixpoints, and a direct interpretation into Heyting arithmetic with partial terms using a hierarchy of satisfaction predicates for almost negative formulae. It concludes by applying van\u00a0den\u00a0Berg and van\u00a0Slooten\u2019s result (Indag Math 29:260\u2013275, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indag.2017.07.009) that Heyting arithmetic with partial terms plus the schema of self realizability for arithmetic formulae is conservative over HA .", "keywords": "Conservativity, Fixpoint theories, Realizability, Satisfaction predicates", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165983056"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s00153-023-00878-2"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
