However, it has been sparsely studied in patients without preoperative diabetes under normal living conditions. Objectives: To study 24-hour interstitial glucose (IG) concentrations, GV, the occurrence of hypoglycemia and dietary intake before and after laparoscopic RYGB and SG in females without diabetes. Setting: Outpatient bariatric units at a community and a university hospital. Methods: Continuous glucose monitoring and open-ended food recording over 4 days in 4 study periods: at baseline, during the preoperative low-energy diet (LED) regimen, and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Results: Of 47 patients included at baseline, 83%, 81%, and 79% completed the remaining 3 study periods. The mean 24-hour IG concentration was similar during the preoperative LED regimen and after surgery and significantly lower compared to baseline in both surgical groups. GV was significantly increased 6 and 12 months after surgery compared to baseline. The self-reported carbohydrate intake was positively associated with GV after surgery. IG concentrations below 3.9 mmol/L were observed in 14/25 (56%) of RYGB- and 9/12 (75%) of SG-treated patients 12 months after surgery. About 70% of patients with low IG concentrations also reported hypoglycemic symptoms. Conclusions: The lower IG concentration in combination with the higher GV after surgery, might create a lower margin to hypoglycemia. This could help explain the increased occurrence of hypoglycemic episodes after RYGB and SG.", "keywords": "Carbohydrate intake, Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), Edinburgh hypoglycemia scale, Glycemic variability, Hypoglycemia, Interstitial glucose concentration, Low-energy diet, Open-ended food record, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, Sleeve gastrectomy", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169510716"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.soard.2023.07.008"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60110399", "scopus-affilname": "Mora lasarett", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Mora", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60003858", "scopus-affilname": "Uppsala Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Uppsala", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "100653649", "scopus-affilname": "Center for Clinical Research Dalarna", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Falun", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Inger", "first_name": "Nilsen", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-9450-3714"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57201275632"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60003858", "scopus-affilname": "Uppsala Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Uppsala", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Magnus", "first_name": "Sundbom", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-6243-2859"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6602745658"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60110399", "scopus-affilname": "Mora lasarett", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Mora", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60012311", "scopus-affilname": "Karolinska Institutet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Johanna", "first_name": "Osterberg", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-7981-5477"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6701566038"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Anna", "first_name": "Laurenius", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-9150-1876"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "22950932900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60003858", "scopus-affilname": "Uppsala Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Uppsala", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Agneta", "first_name": "Andersson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-9795-0624"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57197559372"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60019063", "scopus-affilname": "Falu lasarett", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Falun", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60015216", "scopus-affilname": "Akademiska Sjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Uppsala", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60003858", "scopus-affilname": "Uppsala Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Uppsala", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Arvo", "first_name": "Haenni", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-4346-8506"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56247788700"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
