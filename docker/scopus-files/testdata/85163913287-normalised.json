Single organisms have been identified as markers of poor prognosis. However, in situ imaging of tumors demonstrate a polymicrobial tumor-associated community. To understand the role of these polymicrobial communities in survival, we conducted a nested case-control study in late-stage cancer patients undergoing resection for primary adenocarcinoma. The microbiome of paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples was profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing. We found a consistent difference in the microbiome between paired tumor and adjacent tissue, despite strong individual microbial identities. Furthermore, a larger difference between normal and tumor tissue was associated with prognosis: patients with shorter survival had a larger difference between normal and tumor tissue. Within the tumor tissue, we identified a 39-member community statistic associated with survival; for every log2-fold increase in this value, an individual's odds of survival increased by 20% (odds ratio survival 1.20; 95% confidence interval = 1.04 to 1.33). Our results suggest that a polymicrobial tumor-specific microbiome is associated with survival in late-stage colorectal cancer patients. IMPORTANCE Microbiome studies in colorectal cancer (CRC) have primarily focused on the role of single organisms in cancer progression. Recent work has identified specific organisms throughout the intestinal tract, which may affect survival; however, the results are inconsistent. We found differences between the tumor microbiome and the microbiome of the rest of the intestine in patients, and the magnitude of this difference was associated with survival, or, the more like a healthy gut a tumor looked, the better a patient's prognosis. Our results suggest that future microbiome-based interventions to affect survival in CRC will need to target the tumor community.", "keywords": "16S rRNA sequening, cancer survival, colorectal cancer, microbiome, tumor microbiome", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163913287"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1128/spectrum.05066-22"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
