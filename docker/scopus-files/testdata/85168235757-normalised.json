Herein, we study the outcome of infection with eight different mallard-origin IAV subtypes in two different avian hosts: tufted ducks and chickens. We found that infection and shedding patterns as well as innate immune responses were highly dependent on viral subtypes, host species, and inoculation routes. For example, intraoesophageal inoculation, commonly used in mallard infection experiments, resulted in no infections in contrast to oculonasal inoculation, suggesting a difference in transmission routes. Despite H9N2 being endemic in chickens, inoculation of mallard-origin H9N2 failed to cause viable infection beyond 1\u2009day postinfection in our study design. The innate immune responses were markedly different in chickens and tufted ducks, and despite the presence of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) in tufted duck transcriptomes, it was neither up nor downregulated in response to infection. Overall, we have revealed the heterogeneity of infection patterns and responses in two markedly different avian hosts following a challenge with mallard-origin IAV. These virus-host interactions provide new insights into important aspects of interspecies transmission of IAV. IMPORTANCE Our current findings highlight important aspects of IAV infection in birds that have implications for our understanding of its zoonotic ecology. In contrast to mallards where the intestinal tract is the main site of IAV replication, chickens and tufted ducks show limited or no signs of intestinal infection suggesting that the fecal-oral transmission route might not apply to all bird IAV host species. Our results indicate that mallard-origin IAVs undergo genetic changes upon introduction into new hosts, suggesting rapid adaptation to a new environment. However, similar to the mallard, chickens and tufted ducks show a limited immune response to infection with low pathogenic avian influenza viruses. These findings and future studies in different IAV hosts are important for our understanding of barriers to IAV transmission between species and ultimately from the wild reservoir to humans.", "keywords": "adaptive viral mutations, gene expression, influenza virus, innate immunity", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168235757"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1128/spectrum.02586-22"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
