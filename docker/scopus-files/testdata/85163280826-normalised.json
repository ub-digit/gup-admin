In January and February 1849, many antisemitic letters and articles were published in the Swedish newspapers. Some letters defending Jews and Judaism were published in both \u2018Anonyma L\u00e5dan\u2019 and G\u00f6teborgs Handels-och Sj\u00f6fartstidning. Short of blood libel, the antisemitic side accused Jews of typical anti-Jewish stereotypes: for example, greed, hypocrisy and Jewish hatred of Christianity. Anti-antisemitic writers proclaimed a Christian identity that was based on humanism, stating that one could not be a true Christian if one attacked and hated Jews and Judaism. The Jewish congregation in Gothenburg and the society Judiska Intresset (The Jewish Cause) both chose a non-engaged approach to the antisemitic attacks in the newspaper, since it was not respectable to engage in such debates and, in their view, it would only cause more anti-Jewish sentiments if they did so. In this article, it is argued that the reasons behind the attacks were societal changes, but also, more importantly, that with \u2018Anonyma L\u00e5dan\u2019, antisemitic sentiments found a platform where such sentiments could be freely expressed.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163280826"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.30752/nj.122604"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
