The andragogical perspective engages with development by mobilizing the processes of learning and teaching to support adults as they carry out their tasks in life. The effective dissemination of andragogical perspectives across environments and sites of adult lifelong learning is premised on grasping how new theories, research findings, and social practices have been and still are recasting the notion and understanding of adult education. In this chapter, we seek to offer an overview of the andragogical perspective on adult development by depicting the so-called classical model of factors in adult learning/ teaching, its current perceptions and the effects of the theoretical-empirical transgression associated with adult workplace learning. We offer a brief survey of shifts in conceptualizations of adult learning, including workplace learning, prompted by selected learning theories and an examination of workplace culture in terms of its expansive and restrictive learning environments. In conclusion, we make a case for understanding the adult education perspective on adult development as a dual social practice.", "keywords": "Adult education, Adult learner, Andragogical perspective, Workplace learning", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166094572"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
