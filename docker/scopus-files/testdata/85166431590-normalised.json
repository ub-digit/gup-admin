However, successful innovations depend on joint learning and rewarding collaborations between healthcare and other stakeholders. This study aims to explore how learning develops when entrepreneurs, healthcare professionals and older people collaborate in a primary care living lab. Design/methodology/approach: The study had an action research design and was conducted at a clinically embedded living lab at a primary care centre on the west coast of Sweden. Data consisted of e-mail conversations, recordings from design meetings and three group interviews with each party (entrepreneurs, healthcare professionals and older people). Data were analysed with inductive qualitative content analysis. Findings: An overarching theme, \u201cTo share each other\u2019s worlds in an arranged space for learning\u201d, was found, followed by three categories, \u201cPrerequisites for learning\u201d, \u201cStrategies to achieve learning\u201d and \u201cTo learn from and with each other\u201d. These three categories comprise eight subcategories. Originality/value: This research contributes to knowledge regarding the need for arranged spaces for learning and innovation in primary care and how collaborative learning can contribute to the development of practice.", "keywords": "Action research, Collaborative learning, Innovation, Living lab, Primary care, Qualitative research", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166431590"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1108/JWL-01-2023-0012"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
