However, they are difficult to study in coastal seas in-situ. Here, we induced a phytoplankton spring bloom and followed its fate for 37 days in four 600\u00a0L-mesocosms. To specifically investigate the significance of phytoplankton-born dissolved organic carbon (DOC) we used artificial seawater with low DOC background and inoculated it with a 100\u00a0\u00b5m-prefiltered plankton community from the North Sea. A biphasic bloom developed, dominated by diatoms and Phaeocystis globosa respectively. In between, bacterial numbers peaked, followed by a peak in virus-like particles, implying that virus infection caused the collapse. Concentrations of dissolved free amino acids exhibited rapid changes, in particular during the diatom bloom and until the peak in bacterial abundance. Dissolved combined amino acids and neutral monosaccharides accumulated continuously, accounting for 22% of DOC as a mean and reaching levels as high as 44%. Bacterial communities were largely dominated by Bacteroidetes, especially the NS3a marine group (family Flavobacteriaceae), but Rhodobacteraceae and Gammaproteobacteria were also prominent members. Our study shows rapid organic matter and community composition dynamics that are hard to trace in natural coastal ecosystems.", "keywords": "amino acids, bacterial community, carbohydrates, diatoms, flavobacteria-NS3a, mesocosm, microbial succession, North Sea, phaeocystis, spring bloom", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166442644"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1093/femsec/fiad078"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
