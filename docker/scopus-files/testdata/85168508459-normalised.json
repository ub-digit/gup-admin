Previous studies have shown that the level of digestion of starch by \u03b1-amylase is considerably reduced in the presence of MSPs, and it has been shown to be caused by the adsorption of \u03b1-amylase by MSPs. In this study, we tested a hypothesis of enzymatic deactivation and measured the activity of \u03b1-amylase together with MSPs (SBA-15) using comparably small CNP-G3 (2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl alpha-d-maltotrioside) as a substrate. We showed that pore-incorporated \u03b1-amylase was active and displayed higher activity and stability compared to amylase in solution (the control). We attribute this to physical effects: the coadsorption of CNP-G3 on the MSPs and the relatively snug fit of the amylase in the pores. Biosorption in this article refers to the process of removal or adsorption of \u03b1-amylase from its solution phase into the same solution dispersed in, or adsorbed on, the MSPs. Large quantities of \u03b1-amylase were biosorbed (about 21% w/w) on the MSPs, and high values of the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) and the Michaelis-Menten constant (KM) were observed for the enzyme kinetics. These findings show that the reduced enzymatic activity for \u03b1-amylase on MSP observed here and in earlier studies was related to the large probe (starch) being too large to adsorb in the pores, and potato starch has indeed a hydrodynamic diameter much larger than the pore sizes of MSPs. Further insights into the interactions and environments of the \u03b1-amylase inside the MSPs were provided by 1H fast magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and 13C/15N dynamic nuclear polarization MAS NMR experiments. It could be concluded that the overall fold and solvation of the \u03b1-amylase inside the MSPs were nearly identical to those in solution.", "keywords": "(DNP) MAS NMR, 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl alpha-, mesoporous silica particles, porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase, starch", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168508459"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1021/acsmaterialsau.3c00028"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60028378", "scopus-affilname": "Stockholms universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Muhammad Naeem", "first_name": "Iqbal", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57196464417"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60028378", "scopus-affilname": "Stockholms universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Aleksander", "first_name": "Jaworski", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-7156-559X"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57204851703"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Arthur C.", "first_name": "Pinon", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58544004500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60025747", "scopus-affilname": "Institutionen f\u00f6r Molekyl\u00e4r biovetenskap, Wenner-Grens institut", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Tore", "first_name": "Bengtsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-5396-030X"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7005649704"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60028378", "scopus-affilname": "Stockholms universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Stockholm", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Niklas", "first_name": "Hedin", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-7284-2974"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6603138728"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
