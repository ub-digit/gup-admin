POL\u03b3 mutations impair mitochondrial DNA replication, thereby causing deletions and/or depletion of mitochondrial DNA, which in turn impair biogenesis of the oxidative phosphorylation system. We here identify a patient with a homozygous p.F907I mutation in POL\u03b3, manifesting a severe clinical phenotype with developmental arrest and rapid loss of skills from 18 months of age. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed extensive white matter abnormalities, Southern blot of muscle mtDNA demonstrated depletion of mtDNA and the patient deceased at 23 months of age. Interestingly, the p.F907I mutation does not affect POL\u03b3 activity on single-stranded DNA or its proofreading activity. Instead, the mutation affects unwinding of parental double-stranded DNA at the replication fork, impairing the ability of the POL\u03b3 to support leading-strand DNA synthesis with the TWINKLE helicase. Our results thus reveal a novel pathogenic mechanism for POL\u03b3-related diseases.", "keywords": "Disease, DNA polymerase \u03b3, Mitochondrial replication, mtDNA, TWINKLE helicase", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163798779"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.bbadis.2023.166786"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
