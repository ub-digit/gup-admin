We examined the prevalence of autoantibodies in patients with various neurological diseases and whether patients who had autoantibodies differed in age, sex, or disability from those who did not. Methods: We examined the prevalence of neural surface and onconeural autoantibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum from patients with multiple sclerosis (n = 64), Parkinson disease plus atypical parkinsonism (n = 150), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 43), or autoimmune encephalitis (positive control; n = 7) and a healthy control group (n = 37). A total of 12 onconeural autoantibodies and six neural surface autoantibodies were tested in all participants. Results: Autoantibodies were present in all cohorts. The prevalence of autoantibodies was high (>80%) in the autoimmune encephalitis cohort but low (<20%) in all other cohorts. When comparing patients within cohorts who were positive for autoantibodies to patients who were not, there was no difference in age, sex, and disability. This was apart from the multiple sclerosis and Parkinson disease plus atypical parkinsonism cohorts, where those with positivity for autoantibodies in the CSF were significantly older. Conclusions: The presence of the autoantibodies examined does not appear to have a substantial clinical impact within the diseases examined in this study. The presence of autoantibodies in all cohorts presents a risk for misdiagnosis when the method is used incorrectly on patients with atypical clinical presentation.", "keywords": "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, atypical parkinsonism and Parkinson disease, autoantibodies, autoimmune encephalitis, multiple sclerosis", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164163769"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/ene.15926"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
