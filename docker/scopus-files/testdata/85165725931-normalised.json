Increasing the number of synchronized nano-oscillators in chains holds significance for improved signal quality and emerging applications such as oscillator based unconventional computing. We successfully fabricate spin Hall nano-oscillator chains with up to 50 serially connected nanoconstrictions using W/NiFe, W/CoFeB/MgO, and NiFe/Pt stacks. Our experiments demonstrate robust and complete mutual synchronization of 21 nanoconstrictions at an operating frequency of 10 GHz, achieving line widths <134 kHz and quality factors >79,000. As the number of mutually synchronized oscillators increases, we observe a quadratic increase in peak power, resulting in 400-fold higher peak power in long chains compared to individual nanoconstrictions. While chains longer than 21 nanoconstrictions also achieve complete mutual synchronization, it is less robust, and their signal quality does not improve significantly, as they tend to break into partially synchronized states.", "keywords": "Mutual synchronization, Spin Hall effect, Spin Hall nano-oscillators, Spintronic oscillators", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165725931"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.3c02036"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
