In this study, we investigated the prevalence of discordance in the biomarkers and surrogate subtyping between the primary BC and the LNM, and whether subsequent changes would have altered clinical treatment recommendations. In this retrospective study, 94 patients treated for unifocal primary BC and synchronous LNM at Sahlgrenska UniversityHospital during 2018 were included. Estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor, Ki67, and HER2 status were assessed in the primary tumor and LNM using immunohistochemistry. Discordances between the primary tumor and the LNM were analyzed for each individual biomarker and surrogate subtyping. The concordance between the primary tumor and the LNM for ER, PR, Ki67, and HER2 status was 98.9%, 89.4%, 72.3%, and 95.8%, respectively. Discordance in surrogate subtyping was found in 28.7% of the tumors and matched LNMs, the majority (81.5%) of which changed to a more favorable subtype in the LNM; most commonly from Luminal B to Luminal A (48.6%). No changes in surrogate subtyping were detected where ER or HER2 status changed from negativity in the BC to positivity in the LNM, thereby showing no additional value in performing immunohistochemistry on the LNM from a treatment decision-making perspective. However, large studies need to be performed that test both the primary BCs and synchronous LNMs for more accurate diagnostics.", "keywords": "Biomarkers, Breast cancer, Discordance, Surrogate subtype, Synchronous lymph node metastasis", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163787503"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s10585-023-10214-w"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
