Therefore, we prepared a\u00a0precursor for (radio)iodination of the P2X7 ligand VPGIS191. We then developed\u00a0a radioiodination method with 123I for SPECT with a radiochemical yield of 71 \u00b1 13% and 125I for autoradiography with a radiochemical yield of 85 \u00b1 6%\u00a0Autoradiography of [125I]VPGIS191 in mouse brain cryostat sections demonstrated\u00a0approximately 36 nM binding affinity and Bmax of approximately 400 pmol/gram tissue for P2X7 binding sites. VPGIS191 (cis) had a two-fold lower affinity compared to its geometric trans-isomer TZ6019.
