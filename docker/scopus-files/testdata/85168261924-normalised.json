Since the implementation of advanced recovery protocols, the current global incidence of SWD is unknown. This systematic review and meta-analysis estimated the worldwide incidence of SWD and explored its associated factors in general surgical patients. Eligible full-text cross-sectional, cohort and observational studies in English, between 1 January 2010 to 23 April 2021, were retrieved from MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Data extraction and quality appraisal were undertaken independently by three reviewers. Random effects meta-analytic models were used in the presence of substantial inconsistency. Subgroup, meta-regression and sensitivity analyses were used to explore inconsistency. Publication bias was assessed using Hunter's plots and Egger's regression test. Of 2862 publications retrieved, 27 studies were included in the final analyses. Pooled data from 741,118 patients across 24 studies were meta-analysed. The 30-day cumulative incidence of SWD was 1% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1-1%). SWD incidence was highest in hepatobiliary surgery, at 3% (95% CI: 0-8%). Multivariable meta-regression showed SWD was significantly associated with duration of operation and reoperation (F=7.93 (2-10); p=0.009), explaining 58.2% of the variance. Most studies were retrospective, predated the agreed global definition for SWD and measured as a secondary outcome; thus, our results likely underestimate the scope of the problem. Wider uptake of the global definition will inform the SWD surveillance and improve the accuracy of reporting.", "keywords": "dehiscence, general surgery, incidence, meta-analysis, wound, wound care, wound disruption, wound dressing, wound healing", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168261924"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.12968/jowc.2023.32.Sup8a.S31"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
