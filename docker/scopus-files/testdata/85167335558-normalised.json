Less research has been conducted on how people with disabilities coped with and learned from these challenges. This scoping review maps research conducted in the field of disability research and multidisciplinary research, published from the outbreak of the pandemic until October 31, 2022. The focus is on how people with disabilities adapted their working lives to the conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and what working practices and strategies they applied to manage the situation. From an extensive search in bibliographic databases, eight research articles were identified. The review results reveal both challenges and new openings for the working life of people with disabilities post-pandemic. Implications for future research are identified, addressing intersectionality, hybrid work environments, digital gaps and increased participation of people with disabilities in research.", "keywords": "COVID-19 pandemic, disabilities, hybrid work, post-pandemic, scoping review, working life", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167335558"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.16993/sjdr.1012"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
