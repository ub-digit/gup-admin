Objective: Our primary aim was to determine if birth mode was associated with AD in 3-year-olds and secondarily to determine if birth mode was associated with early onset and/or persistent AD in the first 3 years of life. Methods: We included 2129 mother\u2013child pairs from the Scandinavian population-based prospective PreventADALL cohort with information on birth mode including vaginal birth, either traditional (81.3%) or in water (4.0%), and CS before (6.3%) and after (8.5%) onset of labor. We defined early onset AD as eczema at 3 months and AD diagnosis by 3 years of age. Persistent AD was defined as eczema both in the first year and at 3 years of age, together with an AD diagnosis by 3 years of age. Results: AD was diagnosed at 3, 6, 12, 24, and/or 36 months in 531 children (25%). Compared to vaginal delivery, CS was overall associated with increased odds of AD by 3 years of age, with adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 1.33 (1.02-1.74), and higher odds of early onset AD (1.63, 1.06-2.48). The highest odds for early onset AD were observed in infants born by CS after onset of labor (1.83, 1.09-3.07). Birth mode was not associated with persistent AD. Conclusion: CS was associated with increased odds of AD by 3 years of age, particularly in infants presenting with eczema at 3 months of age.", "keywords": "Atopic dermatitis, birth mode, C-section, caesarean section, early onset atopic dermatitis, obstetrics, persistent atopic dermatitis, vaginal birth, water birth", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164803656"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.jacig.2023.100104"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
