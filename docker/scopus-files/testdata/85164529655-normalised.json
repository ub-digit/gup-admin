During a phytoplankton survey along the Baltic coast of Sweden, we observed numerous Entomoneis cells, some belonging to the well-known Entomoneis paludosa, while others remained unknown. Morphological and ultrastructural studies of the unknown species were performed with light microscopy (LM), scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy, and revealed a unique set of morphological characters. Live cells of Entomoneis grisslehamnensis sp. nov. contain one plate-like plastid and show various degrees of torsion about the apical axis. Microscopic features of cleaned frustules are discussed in comparison with similar species. Most importantly, every 2nd to 5th virga is strongly elevated, uniseriate striae are composed of quadrangular areolae with finely perforated hymenes; the winged keel with a discernible raphe canal is structurally strengthened by raphe fibulae with a flattened wing area, and the main part of the valve bulges towards the margins; striation is decussate on the wings and there is one row of raphe canal areolae at the central area. In addition to describing this new species of an underappreciated, yet cosmopolitan diatom genus, we contribute to the taxonomy of E. paludosa with LM, SEM and TEM details, some of which were not sufficiently noted in original descriptions or re-examination of type material and other specimens made by Dalu et al.
