Here, the rolling out of FX mortgages was part of the late stage and crisis of Hungary\u2019s neoliberal postsocialist model, and the politicization of the ensuing FX crisis became part of the conservative reorganization of the economy by the post-2010 Fidesz regime. Debtors\u2019 movements formulated their grievances in the vocabulary of popular right wing anti-neoliberal movements of the late neoliberal regime. In the first stage of post-2010 Fidesz governance, they were embraced by conservative political propaganda, yet later repressed politically. Showing how links between debtors\u2019 advocacy and conservative politics changed across time according to the progress of economic reconfiguration, the paper argues for specific attention to the strategic field of localized housing finance politics, beyond the abstract conflict between financial interests and housing needs.", "keywords": "financial nationalism, financialization, FX mortgages, housing, Hungary", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165652784"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/13604813.2023.2230770"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
