In this chapter, the concept of CLIL will be unpacked in the sense that the many faces of CLIL in a few parts of the globe are described and explained. Some argue that a certain percentage of all teaching needs to be conducted through an L2 in order for it to be called CLIL, whereas others are of the opinion that any teaching where an L2 is used should be considered as CLIL. This alone speaks of the plethora of CLIL models implemented worldwide. The chapter combines previous research and reports from the basis of testimonies from practitioners and researchers in various CLIL contexts. An important aim of the chapter is to highlight the diversity of CLIL, and to give examples of different CLIL practices.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163450258"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.4324/9781003173151-31"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
