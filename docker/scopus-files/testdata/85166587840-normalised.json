Congruence relations on scalable monoids, direct and tensor products, subalgebras and homomorphic images of scalable monoids, and unit elements of scalable monoids are defined and investigated. A quantity space is defined as a commutative scalable monoid over a field, admitting a finite basis similar to a basis for a free abelian group. Observations relating to the theory of measurement of physical quantities accompany the results about scalable monoids. We conclude that the algebraic theory of scalable monoids and quantity spaces provides a rigorous foundation for quantity calculus.", "keywords": "Monoid, Quantity calculus, Quantity space, Scalable monoid", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166587840"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s00233-023-10371-0"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
