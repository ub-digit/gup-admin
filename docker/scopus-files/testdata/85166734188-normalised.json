We solve the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, in a numerical lattice, for the electron by implementing a Crank-Nicholson implicit method. For the proton and antiproton, a classical description coupled to the quantum electron is proposed to obtain the electron-nuclear dynamics within a semiclassical impact parameter approach. The ionization process is treated by means of an absorbing masking function. We find that the absorbing layer induces an exponential behavior in the ionization process allowing one to determine the asymptotic ionization limit at large times. We assess the validity of the Fermi-Teller criteria for the ionization process at intermediate collision energies. At low collision energies the formation of protonium dominates the ionization process at small impact parameters, while at higher energies larger impact parameters contribute. Excitation probabilities into the n=2 energy level of hydrogen are also reported. Finally, the total, electronic, and nuclear stopping cross sections are determined for collision energies above the closing of the protonium formation channel. The nuclear energy loss has a larger contribution than the electronic at low collision energies, as a consequence of the polarization induced by the antiproton on the hydrogen target. Good agreement is found when compared to available experimental data and other theoretical approaches.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166734188"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1103/PhysRevA.108.012817"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
