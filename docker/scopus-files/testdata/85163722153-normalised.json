Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of apnea and hypopnea as a consequence of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airways due to anatomic and/or functional disturbances. There is mounting evidence of a relationship between OSA and HT. In patients with OSA, HT is predominantly nocturnal and characterized by high diastolic blood pressure and usually by a nondipping pattern. Optimizing the blood pressure control is recommended in the current guidelines as the first treatment option in hypertensive patients with OSA. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy may reduce blood pressure, albeit only slightly as a stand-alone treatment. CPAP, as an add-on treatment to antihypertensive medication, appears to be an efficient treatment modality when both conditions coexist. This narrative review aims to summarize the current perspectives on the association of OSA with HT and the treatment options available for adults with OSA-related HT.", "keywords": "hypertension, narrative review, obstructive sleep apnea", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163722153"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/jcm12124144"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
