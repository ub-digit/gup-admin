Drawing on these examples, as well as post-anthropocentric and posthuman legal scholarship, the authors argue that International Humanitarian Law (IHL) has some potential in developing in a post-anthropocentric direction, specifically in reorienting its focus from armed conflicts to violent outbursts by making use of the Deleuze-Guattarian notion of \u2018war-machines\u2019. The authors argue that this will enable IHL to offer a better protection on a less anthropocentric and more inclusive and equal basis in a shared posthuman ecology. The chapter offers an overview of current legal regulations as well as a theoretical and practice-oriented outline for the development of IHL.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162699338"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.4324/9781003201120-8"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
