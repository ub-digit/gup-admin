How parents distribute responsibilities differs culturally, and governments undertook varied strategies to address COVID-19. Research indicates that the pandemic resulted in increased burden for mothers, but also that it created a novel situation in which parenting and working styles could be re-evaluated. However, Swedish mothers of toddlers and school-aged children were underrepresented in this research, and their voices can contribute to understanding how mothers in countries with different gender norms and lockdown statuses were affected. This study aimed to illuminate how mothers in a country with explicit commitment to gender equality in parenting and no lockdown (Sweden) experienced the pandemic, in contrast to mothers from countries that had lockdowns and different gender norms in parenting (the UK and US). Findings based on 193 mothers&amp;#x2019; qualitative responses to open-ended questions indicated that mothers struggled with COVID-19 financial worries and concerns about family wellbeing. Support, both external and in coparenting, varied considerably among participants. Positives were reported, such as gratitude, closeness, and better quality of coparent interactions. We highlight the importance of considering emotional work, and the need to support parents both in times of crisis and beyond.", "keywords": "coparenting, COVID-19, gratitude, Mothers, pandemic", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166013196"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/13668803.2023.2237179"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
