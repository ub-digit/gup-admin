Beside this broad range of enzymatic substrates, the NUDIX proteins can also be found in different cellular compartments, mainly in the nucleus and in the cytosol, but also in the peroxisome and in the mitochondria. Here we studied two members of the family, NUDT6 and NUDT9. We showed that NUDT6 is expressed in human cells and localizes exclusively to mitochondria and we confirmed that NUDT9 has a mitochondrial localization. To elucidate their potential role within this organelle, we investigated the functional consequences at the mitochondrial level of NUDT6- and NUDT9-deficiency and found that the depletion of either of the two proteins results in an increased activity of the respiratory chain and an alteration of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes expression. We demonstrated that NUDT6 and NUDT9 have distinct substrate specificity in vitro, which is dependent on the cofactor used. They can both hydrolyze a large range of low molecular weight compounds such as NAD+(H), FAD and ADPR, but NUDT6 is mainly active towards NADH, while NUDT9 displays a higher activity towards ADPR.", "keywords": "ADP-ribose, FAD, Mitochondria, NADH, NUDIX, NUDT6, NUDT9", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162981306"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.mito.2023.06.003"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
