Circulating levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), as an oxidative stress marker, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), as a destabilizer of plaques, are known to be elevated in patients with CAD and are associated with worse prognosis. Some studies have suggested that OSA is associated with MPO and MMP-9, but the effect of OSA on these biomarkers in cardiac cohorts is unknown. (2) Aims: We addressed the determinants of high MPO and MMP-9 in a CAD cohort with concomitant OSA. (3) Materials and Methods: The current study was a secondary analysis of the RICCADSA trial that was conducted in Sweden between 2005 and 2013. A total of 502 revascularized CAD patients with OSA (apnea\u2013hypopnea index [AHI] \u2265 15 events/h; n = 391) or no-OSA (AHI < 5 events/h; n = 101), based on a home sleep apnea test, and who had blood samples at baseline were included in the analysis. The patients were dichotomized into a high or low MPO and MMP-9 groups, based on the median cut-off values. (4) Results: The mean age of the participants was 63.9 (\u00b18.6), and 84% of the study cohort were men. Median values of MPO and MMP-9 levels were 116 ng/mL and 269 ng/mL, respectively. In different multivariate linear and logistic regression models, neither OSA nor OSA severity in terms of AHI and oxygenation indices were associated with the high MPO and MMP-9 levels. Current smoking was significantly associated with both high MPO (odds ratio [OR] 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06\u20132.84; p = 0.030) and high MMP-9 levels (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.44\u20134.03; p < 0.001), respectively. Other significant determinants were revealed as beta blocker use (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.04\u20133.16; p = 0.036) for high MPO as well as male sex (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.23\u20133.50; p = 0.006) and calcium antagonist use (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.18\u20133.09; p = 0.008) for high MMP-9 levels. (5) Conclusions: Current smoking, but not OSA, was significantly associated with high MPO and MMP-9 levels in this revascularized CAD cohort. Smoking status should be seriously taken into consideration while evaluating the effects of OSA and its treatment on long-term adverse cardiovascular outcomes in adults with CAD.", "keywords": "coronary artery disease, current smoking, matrix metalloproteinase 9, myeloperoxidase, obstructive sleep apnea", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164000467"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/jcm12124053"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
