In prostate tissue, there are several compartments that can be distinguished from each other, based on different water diffusion decay signals observed. Alterations in cell architecture, such as a relative increase in tumor infiltration and decrease in stroma, will influence the observed diffusion signal in a voxel due to impeded random motion of water molecules. The amount of restricted diffusion can be assessed quantitatively by measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value. This is traditionally calculated using a monoexponential decay formula represented by the slope of a line produced between the logarithm of signal intensity decay plotted against selected b-values. However, the choice and number of b-values and their distribution, has a significant effect on the measured ADC values. There have been many models that attempt to use higher-order functions to better describe the observed diffusion signal decay, requiring an increased number and range of b-values. While ADC can probe heterogeneity on a macroscopic level, there is a need to optimize advanced diffusion techniques to better interrogate prostate tissue microstructure. This could be of benefit in clinical challenges such as identifying sparse tumors in normal prostate tissue or better defining tumor margins. This paper reviews the principles of diffusion MRI and novel higher order diffusion signal analysis techniques to improve the detection of prostate cancer.", "keywords": "ADC, Diffusion, MRI, Prostate, Quality, Quantitative", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169027898"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.ejrad.2023.111066"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60002746", "scopus-affilname": "Harvard Medical School", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Boston", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Fiona M.", "first_name": "Fennessy", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57219956401"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60002746", "scopus-affilname": "Harvard Medical School", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Boston", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Stephan E.", "first_name": "Maier", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55423785900"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
