These crises have impacted everyone, although the effects have been unevenly distributed, leading to further disadvantage and marginalisation for those who were already vulnerable and marginalised. The pandemic laid bare and intensified pre-existing gender inequalities in many aspects of life, from the labor market and educational opportunities to health and social protection systems. The unequal impacts on women and men have been observed in the economy and employment, in domestic work and care, in physical and mental health, and in violence. The collection of articles in this special issue critically interrogates these key issues relat-ing to the impact of the pandemic on gender equality in Europe, highlighting exacerbated gender inequalities, policy responses and the potential for a gender-responsive recovery. This special issue brings together a collection of eight articles that investigate various aspects of gender inequality exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and that explore potential pathways towards achieving greater gender equality in the post-pandemic world. They summarise the findings and contributions of several social scientists and also of two EU funded projects: RESISTIR\u00c9 (GA 101015990) and GEARING Roles (GA 824536). The articles are structured around five main themes: labor market disparities, education and skill development, social and political responses, post-pandemic opportunities, and care. Each article contributes unique insights, empirical findings and policy recommendations from a feminist perspective to enrich the ongoing discourse on gender equality. Together, the articles show the necessity of feminist analysis of crisis, and reveal the structural roots of inequalities while simultaneously emphasising the necessity for transformative action to address inequalities.", "keywords": "care, COVID-19, crisis, decision-making, economy, education, gender, gender equality, policy responses, violence", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167358370"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.5565/rev/papers.3243"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60006565", "scopus-affilname": "Universidad de Deusto", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bilbao", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Spain"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez", "first_name": "Belloso", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-4857-2967"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57191044816"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Sofia", "first_name": "Strid", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-7822-4563"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55148353200"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
