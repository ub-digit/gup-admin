In this study, a labelled and label-free proteomics approach were used to identify differences between the salivary proteomes of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) recipients developing ulcerative oral mucositis (ULC-OM; WHO score \u2265 2) or not (NON-OM). Methods: In the TMT-labelled analysis we pooled saliva samples from 5 ULC-OM patients at each of 5 timepoints: baseline, 1, 2, 3\u00a0weeks and 3\u00a0months after ASCT and compared these with pooled samples from 5 NON-OM patients. For the label-free analysis we analyzed saliva samples from 9 ULC-OM and 10 NON-OM patients at 6 different timepoints (including 12\u00a0months after ASCT) with Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA). As spectral library, all samples were grouped (ULC-OM vs NON-OM) and analyzed with Data Dependent Analysis (DDA). PCA plots and a volcano plot were generated in RStudio and differently regulated proteins were analyzed using GO analysis with g:Profiler. Results: A different clustering of ULC-OM pools was found at baseline, weeks 2 and 3 after ASCT with TMT-labelled analysis. Using label-free analysis, week 1\u20133 samples clustered distinctly from the other timepoints. Unique and up-regulated proteins in the NON-OM group (DDA analysis) were involved in immune system-related processes, while those proteins in the ULC-OM group were intracellular proteins indicating cell lysis. Conclusions: The salivary proteome in ASCT recipients has a tissue protective or tissue-damage signature, that corresponded with the absence or presence of ulcerative oral mucositis, respectively. Trial registration: The study is registered in the national trial register (NTR5760; automatically added to the International Clinical Trial Registry Platform).", "keywords": "Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, Label-free quantification, Multiple myeloma, Oral mucositis, Saliva, TMT-labelled proteomics", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164104748"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s12903-023-03190-w"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
