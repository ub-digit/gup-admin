Focusing on transmission of religious traditions in three Syriac Orthodox parishes, it asks: Where in the church and in what situations does transmission of religious traditions in the parishes take place? Who is part of the transmission of religious traditions in the parishes? How does transmission of religious traditions in the parishes interrelate with family? The article analyses empirical material gathered during ethnographic fieldwork in 2018-2020. The results demonstrate that transmission of religious traditions takes place in the church room, but as well in the church lobby and in meeting rooms, and was more marked in outer relations of family, that is between women in the choir, between children and the community, and in relation to deceased relatives. The church community functioned as an extended family in this diasporic church, and it can be argued that in this case religion is still to be seen as a \u201ccommunal solidarity project\u201d (cf. Smith and Adamczyk 2021).", "keywords": "family, integration, Religious traditions, Syriac Orthodox Church, transmission", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164310055"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.18261/njrs.36.1.2"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
