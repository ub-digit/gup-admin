To support the careful urban planning required, effective and interactive tools that can visualize and communicate information about air quality to stakeholders are essential. In a transdisciplinary research project aiming to explore such visualizations a prototype pedagogical virtual reality tool was developed, allowing users to explore the impact of aspects of the built environment upon urban air quality. The tool was evaluated with adolescents in upper secondary school through interviews and observations, as well as with the general public through a questionnaire study. This paper provides insights, potential solutions, and initial assessments relevant to data visualization in 3D and immersive analytics in urban planning and stakeholder communication. Identified challenges include difficulties with color association and data distinguishability, and as well as tool complexity relating to the many features requested by experts involved in a transdisciplinary project.", "keywords": "3D-city model, Air pollution data, Data visualization, Urban planning, Usability study, Virtual reality", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169006123"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/978-3-031-37189-9_17"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60015017", "scopus-affilname": "H\u00f6gskolan V\u00e4st", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Trollhattan", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Clara", "first_name": "Larsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-8675-019X"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58553913200"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60000990", "scopus-affilname": "Chalmers University of Technology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Beata Stahre", "first_name": "W\u00e4stberg", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-8493-9231"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57196467108"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60015017", "scopus-affilname": "H\u00f6gskolan V\u00e4st", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Trollhattan", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Daniel", "first_name": "Sj\u00f6lie", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-3541-2019"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "23390866700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60000990", "scopus-affilname": "Chalmers University of Technology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Thommy", "first_name": "Eriksson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-2567-2535"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57217720334"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "H\u00e5kan", "first_name": "Pleijel", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-6975-5984"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7006265481"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
