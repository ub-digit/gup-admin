Using methods of causal inference, we studied the effects of sustained behavioral interventions on the long-term risk of developing OW/OB based on a large European cohort. Methods: Our sample comprised 10 877 children aged 2 to < 10\u00a0years at baseline who participated in the well-phenotyped IDEFICS/I.Family cohort. Children were followed from 2007/08 to 2020/21. Applying the parametric g-formula, the 13-year risk of developing OW/OB was estimated under various sustained hypothetical interventions on physical activity, screen time, dietary intake and sleep duration. Interventions imposing adherence to recommendations (e.g. maximum 2\u00a0h/day screen time) as well as interventions \u2018shifting\u2019 the behavior by a specified amount (e.g. decreasing screen time by 30\u00a0min/day) were compared to \u2018no intervention\u2019 (i.e. maintaining the usual or so-called natural behavior). Separately, the effectiveness of these interventions in vulnerable groups was assessed. Results: The 13-year risk of developing OW/OB was 30.7% under no intervention and 25.4% when multiple interventions were imposed jointly. Meeting screen time and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) recommendations were found to be most effective, reducing the incidence of OW/OB by -2.2 [-4.4;-0.7] and -2.1 [-3.7;-0.8] percentage points (risk difference [95% confidence interval]), respectively. Meeting sleep recommendations (-0.6 [-1.1;-0.3]) had a similar effect as increasing sleep duration by 30\u00a0min/day (-0.6 [-0.9;-0.3]). The most effective intervention in children of parents with low/medium educational level was being member in a sports club; for children of mothers with OW/OB, meeting screen time recommendations and membership in a sports club had the largest effects. Conclusions: While the effects of single behavioral interventions sustained over 13\u00a0years were rather small, a joint intervention on multiple behaviors resulted in a relative reduction of the 13-year OW/OB risk by between 10 to 26%. Individually, meeting MVPA and screen time recommendations were most effective. Nevertheless, even under the joint intervention the absolute OW/OB risk remained at a high level of 25.4% suggesting that further strategies to better prevent OW/OB are required.", "keywords": "Causal inference, Childhood obesity, IDEFICS/I.Family cohort, Modifiable risk factor, Observational data, Parametric g-formula", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168707470"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s12966-023-01501-6"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60117061", "scopus-affilname": "Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bremen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Germany"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "C.", "first_name": "B\u00f6rnhorst", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-9004-1540"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "48661790700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60117061", "scopus-affilname": "Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bremen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Germany"}, {"scopus-afid": "60008293", "scopus-affilname": "Universit\u00e4t Bremen", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bremen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Germany"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "I.", "first_name": "Pigeot", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6603777592"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60033316", "scopus-affilname": "Universiteit Gent", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Ghent", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Belgium"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "S.", "first_name": "De Henauw", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55934461100"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60021199", "scopus-affilname": "Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Rome", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Italy"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "A.", "first_name": "Formisano", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "8663186800"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "L.", "first_name": "Lissner", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7007179284"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60007508", "scopus-affilname": "University of P\u00e9cs Medical School", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Pecs", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Hungary"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "D.", "first_name": "Moln\u00e1r", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "16469370800"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60104563", "scopus-affilname": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red-Fisiopatolog\u00eda de la Obesidad y Nutrici\u00f3n", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Madrid", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Spain"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016809", "scopus-affilname": "Universidad de Zaragoza", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Zaragoza", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Spain"}], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "L.
