Manifestations of influenza range from mild upper to severe lower respiratory tract infection. Medical risk groups are defined by factors predisposing for development of severe disease and are recommended annual vaccination as a protective measure. The previous Swedish treatment guidelines for influenza were issued in 2011, and a review of current evidence was deemed relevant. An important reason to revisit the guidelines is the recent approval of a novel drug for influenza treatment, baloxavir. Updated Swedish evidence-based guidelines created by a group of experts from various research areas, for the management of influenza are presented here. The work has been made in collaboration with the Public Health Agency of Sweden and the Swedish Reference Group for AntiViral therapy (RAV). The updated guidelines include guidelines for diagnostics, treatment and prophylaxis in special groups, including management of pregnant women and children with influenza. A new section about infection control has been added. Pharmacological treatment is covered in detail with regards to indication and dosage. Additionally, drug resistance and environmental aspects are discussed.", "keywords": "guidelines, Influenza, prophylaxis, Sweden, treatment", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165383428"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/23744235.2023.2234476"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
