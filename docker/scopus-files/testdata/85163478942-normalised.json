To overcome increasing bacterial infection risk, alloying with antibacterial elements is a promising strategy. This study investigates the effect of minor gallium (Ga) additions (4, 8 wt% Ga) to as-cast and solution-treated \u03b2-type Ti\u201345Nb-based alloy (96(Ti\u201345Nb)-4Ga, 92(Ti\u201345Nb)-8Ga (wt.%)) on corrosion and passive film properties, as well as cytocompatibility and antibacterial activity. The electrochemical properties were evaluated by potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Mott-Schottky analyses in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to analyze the chemical composition of passive films. Early adhesion and viability of macrophages and Staphylococcus aureus were assessed by nucleocounting and colony-forming unit counting, respectively. The results showed that high corrosion resistance and passive film properties of Ti\u201345Nb are retained and even slightly improved with Ga. EIS results revealed that Ga addition improves the passive film resistance. XPS measurements of 92(Ti\u201345Nb)-8Ga show that the passive film contains Ti-, Nb- and Ga-based oxides, implying the formation of mixed (Ti\u2013Nb-Ga) oxides. In addition, marginal Ga ion release rate was detected under free corrosion conditions. Therefore, it can be assumed that Ga species may contribute to passive film formation on Ga-containing alloys. The 92(Ti\u201345Nb)-8Ga elicited an antibacterial effect against S. aureus compared to cp-Ti at 4 h. Moreover, Ga-containing alloys showed good cytocompatibility with THP-1 macrophages at 24 h. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that Ga additions to Ti\u201345Nb are beneficial to corrosion resistance and showed promising initial host and bacterial interactions.", "keywords": "Antibacterial, Corrosion, Cytocompatibility, Gallium, Passive film, \u03b2 titanium alloy", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163478942"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.jmrt.2023.06.219"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
