These include pharmaceuticals, personal-care products, pesticides, surfactants, industrial chemicals, and their transformation products. CECs enter aquatic environments through various sources, including effluents from wastewater treatment plants, industrial facilities, runoff from agricultural and residential areas, as well as accidental spills. Data on the occurrence of CECs in the marine environment are scarce, and more information is needed to assess the chemical and ecological status of water bodies, and to prioritize toxic chemicals for further studies or risk assessment. In this study, we describe a monitoring campaign targeting CECs in surface waters at the Swedish west coast using, for the first time, an on-site large volume solid phase extraction (LVSPE) device. We detected up to 80 and 227 CECs in marine sites and the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, respectively. The dataset will contribute to defining pollution fingerprints and assessing the chemical status of marine and freshwater systems affected by industrial hubs, agricultural areas, and the discharge of urban wastewater.
