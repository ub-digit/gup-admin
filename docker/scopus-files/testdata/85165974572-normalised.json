Methods: In a population-based study during a 33-year period, 142 patients with IBM were identified in western Sweden. Six patients fell outside the European Neuromuscular Centre 2011 criteria for IBM due to young age at symptom onset, verified by a muscle biopsy < 50\u00a0years of age. These were defined as early-onset IBM and included in this study. Medical records, muscle strength, comorbidities, muscle biopsies, and nuclear- and mitochondrial DNA were examined and compared with patients with IBM and age matched controls from the same population. Results: The median age at symptom onset was 36 (range 34\u201345) years and at diagnosis 43 (range 38\u201358) years. Four patients were deceased at a median age of 59 (range 50\u201375) years. The median survival from diagnosis was 14 (range 10\u201318) years. The prevalence December 31 2017 was 1.2 per million inhabitants and the mean incidence 0.12 patients per million inhabitants and year. The mean decline in quadriceps strength \u00b1 1 standard deviation was 1.21 \u00b1 0.2 Newton or 0.91 \u00b1 0.2% per month and correlated to time from diagnosis (p < 0.001). Five patients had swallowing difficulties. All patients displayed mitochondrial changes in muscle including cytochrome c oxidase deficiency and the mitochondrial DNA mutation load was high. Conclusions: Early-onset IBM is a severe disease, causing progressive muscle weakness, high muscle mitochondrial DNA mutation load and a reduced cumulative survival in young and middle-aged individuals.", "keywords": "Epidemiology, Inclusion body myositis, Inflammatory myopathy, Mitochondrial DNA, Muscular weakness", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165974572"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s00415-023-11878-w"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
