Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on inductive multiple-case studies using 34 in-depth interviews. This paper relies on three cases of immigrant entrepreneurs originating from Mexico and Colombia that established firms in Sweden. Findings: The results suggest that EO development trajectories vary in the presence of family roles (i.e.\u00a0inspirers, backers and partners), resulting in the immigrant family business configurations of family-role-influenced proactiveness, risk-taking and innovation. Originality/value: The immigrant family configurations drive three EO-enabling scenarios: (1)\u00a0home-country framing, (2) family backing and (3) transnational translating. Immigrant family dynamics facilitate the development of EO over time through reciprocal interaction processes across contexts. This study indicates that, through family dynamics, EO develops as mutually interactive processes between the immigrant entrepreneur's family in the home and host countries.", "keywords": "Entrepreneurial orientation, Immigrants, Start-ups", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165190115"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1108/IJEBR-07-2022-0602"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
