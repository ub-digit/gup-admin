This bilateral investment court features, amongst other things, an appeals mechanism and thereby responds to widespread criticism over the inconsistency, and consequent lack of legitimacy, of investor-state arbitration. Rather than addressing all aspects of investor-state dispute settlement, however, the investment court system is merely an institutional reform, which depends for all other relevant purposes on established arbitration rules. A TTIP investment court would therefore fall prey to the legal and institutional constraints for which ICSID and UNCITRAL have initially been designed. Taken together with the current US administration\u2019s division on trade and investment policy, the prospects of a TTIP investment court remain all but certain. If successful, on the other hand, it would represent above all an important step towards transatlantic adjudicative institutionalisation.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167577135"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/978-3-319-50221-2_9"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
