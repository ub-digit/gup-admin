A major component of mucus is MUC2, a glycoprotein that is extensively decorated, especially with O-glycans. In the intestine, goblet cells are specialized in controlling glycosylation and making mucus. Some microbiota members are known to encode multiple proteins that are predicted to bind and/or cleave mucin glycans. The interactions between commensal microbiota and host mucins drive intestinal colonization, while at the same time, the microbiota can utilize the glycans on mucins and affect the colonic mucus properties. This review will examine this interaction between commensal microbes and intestinal mucins and discuss how this interplay affects health and disease.", "keywords": "colon, colonization, commensal bacteria, intestine, mucin, glycans, mucus", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164425001"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.chom.2023.05.026"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
