To predict the yield and biochemical composition of the biomass, it is important to understand how the transcriptome of species and strains of interest is affected by seasonal changes. Here we studied the effects of Nordic winter and summer on the transcriptome of two phytoplankton species, namely the diatom Skeletonema marinoi (Sm) and the eustigmatophyte Nannochloropsis granulata (Ng), recently identified as potentially important for biomass production on the west coast of Sweden. Cultures were grown in photobioreactors in simulated Nordic summer and winter, and the gene expression in two phases was quantified by Illumina RNA-sequencing. Five paired comparisons were made among the four conditions. Sm was overall more responsive to seasons since 70 % of the total transcriptome (14,783 genes) showed differential expression in at least one comparison as compared to 1.6 % (1403 genes) for Ng. For both species, we observed larger differences between the seasons than between the phases of the same season. In summer phase 1, Sm cells focused on photosynthesis and polysaccharide biosynthesis. Nitrate assimilation and recycling of intracellular nitrogen for protein biosynthesis were more active in summer phase 2 and throughout winter. Lipid catabolism was upregulated in winter relative to summer to supply carbon for respiration. Ng favored lipid accumulation in summer, while in winter activated different lipid remodeling pathways as compared to Sm. To cope with winter, Ng upregulated breakdown and transport of carbohydrates for energy production. Taken together, our transcriptome data reveal insights into adaptive seasonal responses of Sm and Ng important for biotechnological applications on the west coast of Sweden, but more work is required to decipher the molecular mechanisms behind these responses.", "keywords": "Biomass, Lipids, Nannochloropsis, Seasonal changes, Skeletonema, Transcriptomics", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169617066"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.algal.2023.103222"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Otilia", "first_name": "Cheregi", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "8837079900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Matthew I.M.", "first_name": "Pinder", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57194512231"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Kashif Mohd", "first_name": "Shaikh", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56809003000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Mats X.", "first_name": "Andersson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57210519309"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60107281", "scopus-affilname": "RISE Research Institutes of Sweden AB", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Johan", "first_name": "Engelbrektsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6507542485"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60107281", "scopus-affilname": "RISE Research Institutes of Sweden AB", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Niklas", "first_name": "Str\u00f6mberg", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "8898047100"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60107281", "scopus-affilname": "RISE Research Institutes of Sweden AB", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "Susanne", "first_name": "Ekendahl", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6602853174"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "8", "last_name": "Olga", "first_name": "Kourtchenko", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "14421186700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "9", "last_name": "Anna", "first_name": "Godhe", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6602222834"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60012636", "scopus-affilname": "IVL Svenska Miljoinstitutet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "10", "last_name": "Mats", "first_name": "T\u00f6pel", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "24176423200"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "11", "last_name": "Cornelia", "first_name": "Spetea", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6602753670"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
