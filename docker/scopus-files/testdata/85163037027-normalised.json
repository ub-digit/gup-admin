The primary outcome was the number of days to total relief of pain, stiffness and triggering, as recorded by the patients on visual analogue scales day-by-day for 6 weeks. The median number of days to complete symptom relief was 9 days in the PP group and 11 days in the A1 group for pain, 11 days and 15 days for stiffness and 21 and 20 days for triggering, respectively. Ninety-one per cent of all patients did not require any additional treatment, but 11 patients in both groups reported some remaining symptoms at 6 weeks. This study did not detect any significant difference between the two injection techniques, but provides detailed data of the rate and order of symptomatic relief after corticosteroid injection for this common condition.
