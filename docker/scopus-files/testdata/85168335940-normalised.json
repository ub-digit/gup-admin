We use data from Swedish users of a carbon calculator that includes weekly estimates of users\u2019 consumption-based carbon-equivalent emissions based on detailed financial statements, official registers, and self-reported lifestyle factors. The calculator is designed to induce behavioral change and gives users detailed information about their footprint. By using a robust difference-in-differences analysis with staggered adoption of the calculator, we estimate that users decrease their carbon footprint by around 10% in the first few weeks, but over the next few weeks, the reduction fades. Further analysis suggests that the carbon footprint reduction is driven by a combination of a shift from high- to low-emitting consumption categories and a temporary decrease in overall spending, and not by changes in any specific consumption category.", "keywords": "Carbon footprint, Consumer behavior, Pro-environmental behavior", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168335940"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s10640-023-00800-7"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60108011", "scopus-affilname": "Linnaeus University, V\u00e4xj\u00f6", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Vaxjo", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Jakob", "first_name": "Enlund", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-5660-7317"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58542306800"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60000990", "scopus-affilname": "Chalmers University of Technology", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "David", "first_name": "Andersson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-7359-8272"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55613234994"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Fredrik", "first_name": "Carlsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-4789-8009"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7006565467"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
