We use data from Swedish users of a carbon calculator that includes weekly estimates of users\u2019 consumption-based carbon-equivalent emissions based on detailed financial statements, official registers, and self-reported lifestyle factors. The calculator is designed to induce behavioral change and gives users detailed information about their footprint. By using a robust difference-in-differences analysis with staggered adoption of the calculator, we estimate that users decrease their carbon footprint by around 10% in the first few weeks, but over the next few weeks, the reduction fades. Further analysis suggests that the carbon footprint reduction is driven by a combination of a shift from high- to low-emitting consumption categories and a temporary decrease in overall spending, and not by changes in any specific consumption category.", "keywords": "Carbon footprint, Consumer behavior, Pro-environmental behavior", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168335940"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/s10640-023-00800-7"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
