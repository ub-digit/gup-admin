In this article, we provide a new perspective of bodily experiences of assisted feeding. We apply \"designerly framing\"in the context of meals and Human Robot Interaction (HRI) and contribute with insights for researchers with backgrounds other than design into how \"designerly framing\"can foreground social and aesthetic use. The study focuses on experiences of assisted feeding of five people with impairments in their arms or hands. All of the subjects have long-term experience of meal assistance, and four also have experience of using a robotic eating aid. The data collection comprises seven interview sessions held in peoples homes, a functional analysis of the meal experience, and a workshop held at a design agency. The \"designerly framing\"is also supported by a theoretical framework describing different types of use to open the meal as a design space. This complements and extends existing knowledge on acceptance and abandonment of assistive technology (AT) and assistive robotics for the meal.", "keywords": "accessibility, Additional Key Words and PhrasesRobotic eating aid, aesthetic bodily use, designerly framing, experience, HRI, meal assistance, practical use, qualities, social bodily use", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164241771"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1145/3583742"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
