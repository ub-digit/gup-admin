Surgical treatment has become an increasingly utilised approach with promising results. This study aims to evaluate seizure outcome and complications after surgery in a population-based series of patients with intractable epilepsy and hypothalamic hamartoma. Methods: All patients with hypothalamic hamartoma treated with epilepsy surgery in Sweden since 1995 with at least two years of follow-up were included. Preoperative, two-, five- and ten-year prospective longitudinal data were collected from The Swedish National Epilepsy Surgery Register. Data included seizure types and frequency, duration of epilepsy, clinical characteristics, neurological deficits, cognitive level and complications. In a subgroup from Gothenburg, we also analysed data not included in the register such as classification of hamartomas, surgical procedures and gelastic seizures. Results: Eighteen patients were operated on during the period 1995\u20132020. The median age at epilepsy onset was 6 months and age at surgery 13 years. Four were seizure free and another four had \u226575% reduction in seizure frequency at the two-year follow-up. Two of the 13 patients with a long-term follow-up (five or ten years) were seizure-free and four had \u226575% reduction in seizure frequency. Three had an increased seizure frequency. No major complications were seen. Five had minor complications. In the Gothenburg subgroup all had open pterional disconnection or intraventricular endoscopic disconnection. Six of 12 were free from gelastic seizures at the two-year follow-up and six of eight at the long-term follow-up. Conclusion: This study supports surgical treatment of hypothalamic hamartomas as a safe method with a low risk of permanent complications. The seizure reduction seems to be persistent over time.", "keywords": "Complications, Epilepsy surgery, Hypothalamic hamartoma, Seizure outcome", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162872401"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.ejpn.2023.06.004"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
