Method: Two hundred and six adolescent athletes were recruited during the school year 2016/2017 and randomized into four arms: 4\u00a0weeks body scan, 8\u00a0weeks body scan, 4\u00a0weeks relaxation, and 8\u00a0weeks relaxation. Sleep problems and anxiety were measured at baseline and 4, 8, and 16\u00a0weeks after baseline. Time trends in sleep problems and anxiety were estimated using linear repeated measures models and compared between the four groups. Results: Overall, there were beneficial time changes for sleep problems and anxiety symptoms in all four intervention groups, but significantly so only for anxiety symptoms. Specifically, the reduction of anxiety symptoms varied between \u2212 11% per month for 8\u00a0weeks body scan, \u2212 12% per month for 8\u00a0weeks relaxation, \u2212 13% per month for 4\u00a0weeks relaxation, and \u2212 16% per month for 4\u00a0weeks body scan. However, the time trends did not differ by intervention type or duration. Conclusions: Both types of interventions had beneficial effects on anxiety independent of length of intervention, suggesting that a brief body scan as well as a brief relaxation could be part of a daily recovery practice for adolescent athletes.
