This study aimed to evaluate a new approach for measuring the extent of WMA by calculating the percentage of abnormal wall motion and comparing it to the wall motion score index (WMSI). The study also sought to assess inter- and intra-observer variability. Methods: The study included 140 echocardiograms from 54 patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction or Takotsubo syndrome. All patients underwent an echocardiographic examination according to a standard protocol and the images were used to measure the extent of akinesia (proportion akinesia, PrA), akinesia and hypokinesia (proportion akinesia/hypokinesia, PrAH), and WMSI. The inter-observer variability between the two operators was analyzed. The intra-observer analysis was performed by one observer using the same images at least 1 month after the first measurement. The agreement was analyzed using the Pearson correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots. Results: Inter- and intra-observer variability for PrA and PrAH were low and comparable to those for WMSI. Conclusion: PrA and PrAH are reliable and reproducible echocardiographic methods for the evaluation of left ventricular wall motion.", "keywords": "echocardiography, myocardial infarction, takotsubo syndrome, wall motion abnormality", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162902985"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/echo.15638"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
