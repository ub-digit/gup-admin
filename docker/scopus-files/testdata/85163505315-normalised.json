The classic types described are type I-III where type I is cerebellar tonsillar descent into foramen magnum beyond 5 mm. Chiari II is a more severe form with herniation of fourth ventricle through foramen magnum and is always associated with neural tube defects. Chiari III is a very rare form of encephalocele containing cerebellum and brainstem. The three share a common smaller posterior fossa but it is not clear if they share a common mechanism for formation during the embryonic period. Chiari I is the most common form of Chiari malformation and the one found at times as an incidental finding among general population. Recently the Chiari I category has been expanded to include Chiari 0 and Chiari 1.5 as an attempt to describe the variety seen in patient population specially the paediatric patients. This Chapter will mainly describe Chari I which is the most common type of Chiari malformations.", "keywords": "Chiari I, Chiari malformation, Suboccipital decompression, Syringomyelia", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163505315"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1007/978-3-030-94829-0_17"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
