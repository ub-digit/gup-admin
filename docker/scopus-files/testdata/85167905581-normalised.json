However, there is still a lack of data on cat molecular allergens in adults. Therefore, we aimed to uncover the sensitization patterns to cat molecular allergens. Methods: Participants were recruited from the West Asthma Sweden Study, a population-based study enriched with asthma subjects aged 16\u201375\u00a0years. Of 1872, 361 individuals were positive for cat dander immunoglobulin E and were further analysed for cat molecular allergens (Fel d 1/2/4/7). Sensitization patterns were classified as monosensitization, polysensitization, and concomitant sensitization, and were related to demographic and clinical measurements. Results: Among cat-sensitized subjects, 84.2% were sensitized to secretoglobin, while 42.4% were sensitized to lipocalins. Nearly half of the subjects were monosensitized to Fel d 1. Polysensitization was observed in 20.2%, and concomitant sensitization to protein families was seen in 7.2%. Asthma prevalence, cat exposure, and rural living were associated with poly- and concomitant sensitization to protein families. Concomitant sensitization to single allergens was more common in those with asthma than in those without, while concomitant sensitization to both Fel d 1 and Fel d 4 was the most common pattern in individuals with asthma. Sensitization patterns also differed according to cat ownership and the degree of urbanization. Conclusion: Sensitization to molecular allergens was observed in 90.9% of cat-sensitized subjects and showed variations across participants' background characteristics and the presence of asthma. Identification of sensitization patterns to cat allergens might provide better characterization of cat-allergic subjects.", "keywords": "allergic sensitization, cat allergy, Fel d 1, lipocalins, molecular allergens", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167905581"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1002/clt2.12294"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
