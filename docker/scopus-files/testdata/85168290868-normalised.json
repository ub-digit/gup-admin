In this study, our aim was to establish how well-standard clinical metrics compared to process scores derived from wordlist and story recall tests in predicting biomarker determined Alzheimer\u2019s disease, as defined by CSF ptau/A\u03b242 ratio. Methods: Data from 295 participants (mean age\u00a0=\u00a065\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.) were drawn from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center (ADRC) and Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer\u2019s Prevention (WRAP). Rey\u2019s Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT; wordlist) and Logical Memory Test (LMT; story) data were used. Bayesian linear regression analyses were carried out with CSF ptau/A\u03b242 ratio as outcome. Sensitivity analyses were carried out with logistic regressions to assess diagnosticity. Results: LMT generally outperformed AVLT. Notably, the best predictors were primacy ratio, a process score indexing loss of information learned early during test administration, and recency ratio, which tracks loss of recently learned information. Sensitivity analyses confirmed this conclusion. Conclusions: Our study shows that story recall tests may be better than wordlist tests for detection of dementia, especially when employing process scores alongside conventional clinical scores.", "keywords": "biomarkers, dementia, Memory, serial position, story recall", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168290868"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/13803395.2023.2240060"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
