The goal of the present study was to explore how writing during encoding\u2014through handwriting and through keyboarding\u2014fares compared with enacting, in supporting memory recall. Methods: One hundred Norwegian high school students (64 girls, 36 boys) aged 16\u201321 years (M\u00a0=\u00a017.1) participated in the study. Four lists of verb\u2013noun sentences with 12 sentences in each list were presented in four encoding conditions: (i) motor enactment, (ii) verbal listening, (iii) handwriting, and (iv) keyboarding. Results: Results revealed\u00a0a significant main effect of encoding condition, with the best memory gained in the enactment condition. Regarding writing, results showed that handwriting and keyboarding during encoding produced the lowest recall in comparison with the enactment and verbal listening conditions. Conclusion: These results thus provide additional support for the enactment effect. While there has been much discussion on the relative benefits of handwriting versus keyboarding on student performance, both seemed to be equally poor strategies for the particular learning task explored here, potentially through increased cognitive load.", "keywords": "enactment, encoding, handwriting, keyboard writing, memory recall", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168476395"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1002/brb3.3226"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60110772", "scopus-affilname": "Western Norway University of Applied Sciences", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bergen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "G\u00f6ran B.W.", "first_name": "S\u00f6derlund", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-5941-8431"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "18438668800"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "130101568", "scopus-affilname": "Trudvang Skule", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Sogndal", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Silje", "first_name": "Torvanger", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58544441100"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60029929", "scopus-affilname": "Massachusetts General Hospital", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Boston", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United States"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Nouchine", "first_name": "Hadjikhani", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6701750768"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Jakob \u00c5sberg", "first_name": "Johnels", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55759535900"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
