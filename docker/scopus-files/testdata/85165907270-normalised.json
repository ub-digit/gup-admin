Though likelihood of RTW has been associated with education level, less is known about the association over time, post-RTW. We aimed to investigate associations between educational level and SRTW among long-term sick-listed workers with depression. METHODS: Nationwide cohort study, based on linked data from Norwegian health and population registries, including all inhabitants of Norway aged 20-64 years on long-term sick leave with a depression diagnosis given in general practice between 1 January 2009 and 10 April 2011 (n=13.624, 63.7% women). Exposure was the highest attained education level (five groups). Three outcome measures for SRTW were used, with 0 days, \u226430 days and \u226490 days of accumulated sickness absence post-RTW during a 2-year follow-up. Associations between exposure and outcomes were estimated in gender-stratified generalised linear models, adjusting for sociodemographic factors and duration of sick leave. RESULTS: Higher-educated workers had a higher likelihood of SRTW 0, SRTW \u226430 and SRTW \u226490 than the lowest-educated groups in the crude models. Among men, this association was mainly explained when adjusting for occupation. Among women, the highest educated group had a higher likelihood of SRTW 0 (RR=1.45, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.71) and SRTW \u226430 and SRTW \u226490 in the fully adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: An educational gradient in SRTW was mainly explained by occupation among men but not among women. These findings suggest gendered differences in associations between education level and SRTW, which could inform interventions aiming to promote equal opportunities for SRTW.", "keywords": "depression &amp; mood disorders, health equity, mental health, public health, registries", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165907270"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1136/bmjopen-2023-072051"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60114851", "scopus-affilname": "NORCE Norwegian Research Centre AS", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bergen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}, {"scopus-afid": "60029622", "scopus-affilname": "Universitetet i Bergen", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bergen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Heidi Marie", "first_name": "Meling", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-2797-7957"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57226136814"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60114851", "scopus-affilname": "NORCE Norwegian Research Centre AS", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bergen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}, {"scopus-afid": "60029622", "scopus-affilname": "Universitetet i Bergen", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bergen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Sabine", "first_name": "Ruths", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6603016175"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60114851", "scopus-affilname": "NORCE Norwegian Research Centre AS", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bergen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}, {"scopus-afid": "60114851", "scopus-affilname": "NORCE Norwegian Research Centre AS", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bergen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Valborg", "first_name": "Baste", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6602241833"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Gunnel", "first_name": "Hensing", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7003627285"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60114851", "scopus-affilname": "NORCE Norwegian Research Centre AS", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bergen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}, {"scopus-afid": "60029622", "scopus-affilname": "Universitetet i Bergen", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bergen", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Inger", "first_name": "Haukenes", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "26433352000"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
