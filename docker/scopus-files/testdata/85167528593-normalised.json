This study investigates the association of feeding difficulties and generic health-related quality of life among children aged 2-7 and 8-17 years, born with esophageal atresia. METHODS: 108 families (n\u2009=\u200936 aged 2-7 years; n\u2009=\u200972 aged 8-17) answered a survey regarding difficulties in their child's mealtimes and a validated generic health-related quality of life instrument(PedsQL 4.0). Clinical data was collected from hospital records. The association of feeding difficulties and health-related quality of life was analysed trough Mann-Whitney U-test. Linear regression determined whether the number of concurrent feeding difficulties in the child decreased the health-related quality of life scores. P\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In children aged 2-7 and 8-17 years, to have a gastrostomy, to use a food infusion pump, need for energy-enriched food and eating small portions were respectively significantly associated with lower total health-related quality of life scores in the parent-reports (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Most of the feeding difficulties had a negative significant relationship with the domains of physical and social functioning. Additionally, in the older age group, long mealtimes and adult mealtime supervision were associated with lower scores in both child and parent reports. In both age groups, an increased number of feeding difficulties in the child decreased the total generic health-related quality of life scores (p\u2009<\u20090.01). CONCLUSION: Specific feeding difficulties are associated with low health-related quality of life among children with esophageal atresia. An increasing number of feeding difficulties is associated to decreasing health-related quality of life-scores. Further research is needed to understand these associations.", "keywords": "Eating, Esophageal atresia, Feeding difficulties, Health-related quality of life", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167528593"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s13023-023-02836-w"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60008841", "scopus-affilname": "Drottning Silvias Barnsjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60008841", "scopus-affilname": "Drottning Silvias Barnsjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Sofie", "first_name": "\u00d6rn\u00f6 Ax", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-4745-0119"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57750279400"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60008841", "scopus-affilname": "Drottning Silvias Barnsjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60008841", "scopus-affilname": "Drottning Silvias Barnsjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Michaela", "first_name": "Dellenmark-Blom", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55797771600"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60008841", "scopus-affilname": "Drottning Silvias Barnsjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60008841", "scopus-affilname": "Drottning Silvias Barnsjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Kate", "first_name": "Abrahamsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7006100211"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60008841", "scopus-affilname": "Drottning Silvias Barnsjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60008841", "scopus-affilname": "Drottning Silvias Barnsjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Linus", "first_name": "J\u00f6nsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "38661244100"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60008841", "scopus-affilname": "Drottning Silvias Barnsjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60008841", "scopus-affilname": "Drottning Silvias Barnsjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Vladimir", "first_name": "Gatzinsky", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "15519536300"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
