Although tourism literature is quite abundant with theory and practical insights on visitor experience, it tends to isolate differently abled visitors. One of the better examples of holistic travel, sustainable tourism, seems to omit equity and inclusion from its philosophical underpinnings, which can be seen in the operation of various so-called sustainable businesses. The 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) demonstrate all goals being interconnected and interdependent; accordingly, sustainability should also incorporate equity and contribute to the reduction of inequalities. To address this conceptual and practical omission, the authors extend the discussion to differently abled visitors with the aim of creating inclusive and sustainable tourism experiences for all visitors. Building on the theoretical insights from the Guests\u2019 Site-Adapted Sustainability Tour Experience Model, this conceptual study deals with the inclusive visitor experience through the lens of equity in sustainable tourism. The application of two case studies from Costa Rica extend the contribution of the adapted conceptual framework to practical examples in the tourism industry.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162621639"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.4324/9781003230748-23"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
