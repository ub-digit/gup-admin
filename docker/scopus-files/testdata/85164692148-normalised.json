However, the factors controlling its prevalence remain inadequately understood. In this work, we analyzed concurrent hourly monitoring data of NO3\u2212 in PM2.5 at a pair of urban and suburban locations (28 km apart) in Hong Kong for a period of two months. The concentration gradient in PM2.5 NO3\u2212 was 3.0 \u00b1 2.9 (urban) vs. 1.3 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcg m\u22123 (suburban) while that for its precursors nitrogen oxides (NOx) was 38.1 vs 4.1 ppb. NO3\u2212 accounted for 45 % of the difference in PM2.5 between the sites. Both sites were characterized to have more available NH3 than HNO3. Urban nitrate episodes, defined as periods of urban-suburban NO3\u2212 difference exceeding 2 \u03bcg m\u22123, constituted 21 % of the total measurement hours, with an hourly NO3\u2212 average gradient of 4.2 and a peak value of 23.6 \u03bcg m\u22123. Our comparative analysis, together with 3-D air quality model simulations, indicates that the high NOx levels largely explain the excessive NO3\u2212 concentrations in our urban site, with the gas phase HNO3 formation reaction contributing significantly during the daytime and the N2O5 hydrolysis pathway playing a prominent role during nighttime. This study presents a first quantitative analysis that unambiguously shows local formation of NO3\u2212 in urban environments as a driver for urban episodic PM2.5 pollution, suggesting effective benefits of lowering urban NOx.", "keywords": "Local nitrate formation, MARGA, Online measurement, PM  nitrate 2.5, Urban-suburban gradient", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164692148"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165351"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
