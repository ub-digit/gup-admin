In addition to functionality, minimally invasive implantation methods and bioresorbable materials are central to nonchronic treatments. The latter avoids the need for surgical removal after disease relief. Self-organizing substrate-free organic electrodes meet these criteria and integrate seamlessly into dynamic biological systems in ways difficult for classical rigid solid-state electronics. Here we place bioresorbable electrodes with a brain-matched shear modulus\u2014made from water-dispersed nanoparticles in the brain\u2014in the targeted area using a capillary thinner than a human hair. Thereafter, we show that an optional auxiliary module grows dendrites from the installed conductive structure to seamlessly embed neurons and modify the electrode\u2019s volume properties. We demonstrate that these soft electrodes set off a controlled cellular response in the brain when relaying external stimuli and that the biocompatible materials show no tissue damage after bioresorption. These findings encourage further investigation of temporary organic bioelectronics for nonchronic treatments assembled in vivo.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165556967"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1038/s41467-023-40175-3"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
