The speech of the interviewees was transcribed and annotated for realization of CMI and for relevant morphosyntactic parameters. Speakers were found to vary in the amount of CMI in their speech, but all perform far below the prescriptive ideal, with realizations of case inflection ranging from 0. 2% to 42.3% (mean 7.5%, median 3.6%) and mood inflection from 0% to 68.5% (mean 9.9%, median 2.5%). Furthermore, speakers show striking similarities in how the CMI that they do use is distributed in morphosyntactic contexts. First, CMI is for all speakers used at markedly higher rates in words with enclitic pronouns and on words where CMI is orthographically represented. Second, for words with definite article, CMI is almost completely absent. Implications of these results for Arabic language instruction are discussed.", "keywords": "case, corpus linguistics, mood, morphology, spoken language, Standard Arabic", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162991947"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.13173/zeitarabling.74.0061"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
