Se NPs were synthesized by a simple and cost effective chemical reduction method using selenious acid, GS and sodium borohydride. Gum shellac was used as stabilizing agent. The orange red gum shellac-selenium nanoparticles (GS-Se NPs) were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The morphology of these particles appeared to be uniform and spherical as observed in SEM images. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopic profile showed the presence of elemental selenium, carbon and oxygen. The synthesized GS-Se NPs were investigated for their photo-catalytic efficiency towards degradation of methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) dye in aqueous media. Absorbance was measured at \u03bbmax 665nm and 455nm for MB and MO, respectively. Maximum degradation of MB in-comparison with MO obtained at 50mg/L were 81.72% and 71.42% respectively. A very slow degradation rate was observed for the MO and MB in the absence of synthesized photocatalyst whereas greater percentage degradation was observed for the GS-Se NPs.", "keywords": "dye degradation, environmental pollution, industrial effluents, photocatalyst, selenium nanoparticles", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165423463"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1515/zpch-2022-0113"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
