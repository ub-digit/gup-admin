Here we show that the commensal microbiota weakens the intestinal barrier by suppressing epithelial neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Microbial colonization of germ-free mice dampens signaling of the intestinal Hh pathway through epithelial Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, resulting in decreased epithelial NRP1 protein levels. Following activation via TLR2/TLR6, epithelial NRP1, a positive-feedback regulator of Hh signaling, is lysosomally degraded. Conversely, elevated epithelial NRP1 levels in germ-free mice are associated with a strengthened gut barrier. Functionally, intestinal epithelial cell-specific Nrp1 deficiency (Nrp1 \u0394IEC) results in decreased Hh pathway activity and a weakened gut barrier. In addition, Nrp1 \u0394IEC mice have a reduced density of capillary networks in their small intestinal villus structures. Collectively, our results reveal a role for the commensal microbiota and epithelial NRP1 signaling in the regulation of intestinal barrier function through postnatal control of Hh signaling.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164103446"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1038/s42255-023-00828-5"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
