Bacillares (Leguminosae, Cassieae) is the largest of the American Senna series, with approximately 50 species. Several taxa are still poorly known or with problematic delimitation. Based on extensive fieldwork and collection-based research for our ongoing taxonomic studies on Senna ser. Bacillares, we identified two new species which we here describe as S. dryadica and S. franciscana. In addition, we recognize S. gloriosa as a morphologically and ecologically distinct species, rather than as a variety of S. splendida. The two new species are illustrated and described, and distributional and phenological data as well as a preliminary conservation assessment for each species is provided.", "keywords": "Andean slopes, Atlantic forest, Bolivian Flora, Brazilian flora, Caatinga, Caesalpinioideae, Cassia, continental dunes, Desengano State Park, fabaceae, seasonally dry forests, systematics, S\u00e3o Francisco River, taxonomy", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168154156"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/njb.03947"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
