Early mobilization differs from most other interventions in intensive care since the patient\u2019s participation is requested. What kind of challenges this entails for the intensive care clinicians, and what is crucial in successful early mobilization from their perspective, is sparsely explored and was therefore the purpose of this study. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were held with 17 intensive care clinicians, seven nurses, five assistant nurses and five physiotherapists. The interviews were analyzed with a phenomenographic methodology. Findings: Four descriptive categories emerged: 1) Taking responsibility; 2) Taking the patient\u2019s perspective; 3) Time or not time to mobilize; and 4) The \u201cknow-how\u201d of early mobilization. Early mobilization was perceived as an important and crucial part of intensive care. It includes positioning and sensory stimulation, which could be used to re-orientate the patient and prevent delirium. The patients\u2019 experiences were considered individual with a mix of strong emotions. Despite the stated significance of early mobilization, different conceptions were expressed about the right time, some of them based on concerns for the patient, and some due to safety concerns. In the optimal active mobilization to upright positions there was an emphasis on careful preparation and patient involvement, including negotiation and active participation. Conclusions: The importance of early mobilization is indisputable. Successful early mobilization is achieved by applying a person-centered approach, involving the patient as an active partner. Early mobilization comprises positioning and sensory stimulation and should be included in the daily planning of patient care.", "keywords": "Barriers, clinician, early mobilization, intensive care, person-centredness", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165670360"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1080/09593985.2023.2239891"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60006652", "scopus-affilname": "Skaraborgs Sjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Skovde", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Annika", "first_name": "S\u00f6derberg", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-8904-2415"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57218536266"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60010345", "scopus-affilname": "H\u00f6gskolan i Sk\u00f6vde", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Skovde", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Veronika", "first_name": "Karlsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-9423-9378"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "23392410700"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Monika", "first_name": "Fagevik Ols\u00e9n", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-0207-4105"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55878909100"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "116883792", "scopus-affilname": "Kung\u00e4lv Hospital", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Kungalv", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Anneli", "first_name": "Thelandersson", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "14122507100"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60006652", "scopus-affilname": "Skaraborgs Sjukhus", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Skovde", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Anita", "first_name": "Johansson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-9019-2402"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "36570605600"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
