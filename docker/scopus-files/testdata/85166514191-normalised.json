All participants answered a questionnaire, passed a structured interview about work and medical history and several neurophysiological tests. The prevalence of vibration white fingers (VWF) and neurosensory symptoms was significantly higher among the exposed patients than among the truck mechanics. One neurosensory examination method identified 46% of the exposed patients with numbness and tingling, three methods up to 85%. In the total material logistic regression showed that age and increased cold sensitivity were significant predictors of both neurosensory disturbances and vibration white fingers. Muscle cramps in arms and hands, pain in hands and age were significant predictors of reduced grip strength. The differences between the two groups were more pronounced for category variables than for continuous variables.", "keywords": "neurosensory disturbances, quantitative sensory testing, truck mechanics, Vibration exposure, vibration white fingers", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166514191"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/09574565231193047"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Lars", "first_name": "Gerhardsson", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0003-0173-8122"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55452330400"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Mats", "first_name": "Hagberg", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-1182-8239"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57203629076"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
