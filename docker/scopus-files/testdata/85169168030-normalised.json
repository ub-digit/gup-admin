Based on an empirical study of Swedish game development studios, we conceptualize two different approaches to innovation: a more inward-oriented and developer-centric (i.e., closed) approach and a more outward-oriented and user-centric (i.e., open) approach. Given that the firms in this study are acting under similar contingencies while adopting very different innovation approaches, we introduce innovation logics as a theoretical concept to understand how founders and managers justify their choice of approach (i.e., open vs. closed). Inspired by the \u2018orders of worth\u2019 framework by Boltanski and Th\u00e9venot, we highlight two distinctive innovation logics\u2014that is, a creative logic versus an iterative logic\u2014that the interviewees draw on. This paper contributes to the open innovation literature by highlighting two forms of innovation approaches and explaining how and why they differ in terms of \u2018openness\u2019 in relation to the surrounding ecosystem.", "keywords": "digital games, innovation approaches, innovation ecosystem, innovation logics, open innovation", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85169168030"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/caim.12573"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60254874", "scopus-affilname": "Handelsh\u00f6gskolan", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Bj\u00f6rn Remneland", "first_name": "Wikhamn", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-9707-5599"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55848842400"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60254874", "scopus-affilname": "Handelsh\u00f6gskolan", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Alexander", "first_name": "Styhre", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-8347-2665"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6603238111"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
