This article analyses how some of the pillars of such a new generation of social policy may be conceptualized by highlighting commonalities between the most recent IPCC report and the sustainable welfare literature. Methodologically triangulating content analysis of the IPCC report, literature review and qualitative data analysis from citizen forums, we argue that this convergence is particularly evident in four areas central to policymaking: the importance of human needs in eco-social policymaking; the identification of governance structures suitable for a social-ecological transformation; the requirement to co-develop policies via a deliberative, \u00abbottom-up\u00bb element; and the need to decouple welfare provision from economic growth.", "keywords": "Climate crisis, degrowth/postgrowth, eco-social policies, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), sustainable welfare", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168348533"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.7389/107137"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60029170", "scopus-affilname": "Lunds Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Max", "first_name": "Koch", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56153696900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60012070", "scopus-affilname": "University of Leeds", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Leeds", "scopus-affiliation-country": "United Kingdom"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Milena", "first_name": "B\u00fcchs", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "23570370300"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Jayeon", "first_name": "Lee", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56046854300"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
