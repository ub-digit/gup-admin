In this paper, \u2018self-regulation\u2019 is related to the concept of \u2018autonomy\u2019, a concept which is analysed on the two dimensions of \u2018purpose\u2019 and \u2018authority\u2019, resulting in four models of state governance and consequently in a different \u2018space of action\u2019 for the institutions. However, in order to develop self-regulation, the space granted must also be used effectively to realise autonomy. Six Swedish higher education institutions are analysed concerning how they have used their new space of action and what restrictions they have met in their efforts for self-regulation.", "keywords": "Education Institution, Education Research, High Education, High Education Institution, State Governance", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164200583"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1023/A:1018732815542"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
