Some assume that intra-party divides are between professional politicians and grassroots members, others highlight the importance of ideological blocs. Yet, precisely mapping factional structures, especially ideological factions, is difficult because of the \u201cblack box of intra-party politics.\u201d Based on theories of party change and spatial competition, we argue for the existence of two distinct ideological factional dimensions that may differ from hierarchical factions. We test our expectations by triangulating evidence from three unique datasets from Sweden: a survey of party members, a media content analysis, and interviews with politicians. Our mixed-methods approach allows identifying the number, structure, content, sizes, and ideological positions of factions. The results show substantial variation in all aspects and that hierarchical and ideological factions rarely coincide. These findings have important theoretical, conceptual, and methodological implications for comparative politics.", "keywords": "political parties, qualitative methods, quantitative methods", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167561384"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1177/00104140231194067"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Ann Kristin", "first_name": "K\u00f6lln", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-8828-2262"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56436540100"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60029170", "scopus-affilname": "Lunds Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Lund", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Jonathan", "first_name": "Polk", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0002-0125-8850"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55462533700"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
