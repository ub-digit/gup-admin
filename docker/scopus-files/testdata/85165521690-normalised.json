MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review and content analysis was undertaken on patients' experiences of and preferences for surgical wound care discharge education. Four themes were uncovered in the literature (wound care discharge education, preferences for discharge education delivery, participation in wound care decisions and patient ability to manage their surgical wound to prevent wound complications), which guided item generation. Three types of validity testing occurred including: 1) face validity testing by the research team; 2) content validity testing (using Delphi study) with an international panel of experts including patients, clinicians and researchers; and 3) content validity (using pilot-testing) of the survey with seven patients from the target population. RESULTS: Initially 106 items were generated from the literature, and of these, 55 items were subjected to content validity testing by an international panel of 41 experts. After two Delphi rounds, 18 items were retained. Most patients provided limited and very minor feedback during pilot-testing. However, pilot-testing resulted in a revised survey administration plan to deliver the survey via telephone, including adding prompts and preambles to items. CONCLUSION: An 18-item survey comprised of three groups of items and an individual item was rigorously developed. The survey requires further testing among a larger sample of patients to confirm the items reflect important aspects of patients' experiences of and preferences for surgical wound care discharge education.", "keywords": "Discharge education, Patient participation, Surgical wounds, Surveys and questionnaires, Wounds and injuries", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165521690"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.jtv.2023.06.003"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
