We have previously shown decreased disease activity in patients with PsA with a body mass index (BMI)\u2009\u2265\u200933\u00a0kg/m2 following weight loss treatment with Very Low Energy Diet (VLED), resulting in a median weight loss of 18.6% at six months (M6) after baseline (BL). In this study we assessed the effects of VLED on cytokines and adipokines at M6 in the same patients with PsA and controls (matched on sex, age and weight). METHODS: VLED (640\u00a0kcal/day) during 12 or 16\u00a0weeks, depending on BL BMI\u2009<\u200940 or\u2009\u2265\u200940\u00a0kg/m2, was taken and followed by an energy-restricted diet. Cytokines and adipokines were measured with Magnetic Luminex Assays at BL and M6. RESULTS: Serum interleukin (IL)-23, (median (interquartile range) 0.40 (0.17-0.54) ng/mL vs. 0.18 (0.10-0.30) ng/mL, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and leptin (26.28 (14.35-48.73) ng/mL vs. 9.25 (4.40-16.24) ng/mL, p\u2009<\u20090.001) was significantly decreased in patients with PsA. Serum total (tot)-adiponectin and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin increased significantly. Similar findings were found in controls. Also, in patients with PsA, \u2206BMI was positively correlated with \u2206IL-23 (rS\u2009=\u20090.671, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In addition, significant positive correlations were found between \u0394BMI and \u0394Disease Activity Score (DAS28CRP), \u0394CRP, \u0394tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, \u0394IL-13, \u2206IL-17 and \u0394leptin, and negative correlations between \u0394BMI and \u0394tot-adiponectin. CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss was associated with decreased levels of leptin and cytokines, in particular IL-23. These findings may partly explain the anti-inflammatory effect of weight reduction in PsA.
