Curettage alone is a simple, non-aggressive and inexpensive treatment method commonly used on benign skin lesions. However, only one study has assessed curettage for treatment of IEC. Objective: We aimed to (1) compare the effectiveness of cryosurgery (standard method) to curettage (experimental method) for treatment of IEC in regard to overall clearance rates at 1-year follow-up, and (2) investigate whether wound healing times differed between the treatment groups. Methods: In this randomized and controlled, non-inferiority trial, adult patients with one or more IEC with a diameter of 5\u201320 mm, located above the knee and suitable for destructive treatment were recruited from Sahlgrenska University Hospital (Gothenburg, Sweden). Lesions were randomized to treatment with either cryosurgery or curettage. Wound healing was assessed by a nurse after 4\u20136 weeks and through self-report forms. Overall clearance was assessed by a dermatologist after 1 year. Results: In total, 183 lesions in 147 patients were included, with 93 lesions randomized to cryosurgery and 90 to curettage. Eighty-eight (94.6%) of the lesions in the cryosurgery group and 71 (78.9%) in the curettage group showed an overall clearance at the 1-year follow-up visit (p = 0.002). The non-inferiority analysis was inconclusive. Curettage resulted in both shorter self-reported wound healing times (mean time 3.1 vs. 4.8 weeks, p < 0.001) and a larger proportion of healed wounds after 4\u20136 weeks (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Cryosurgery and curettage both result in high clearance rates for treatment of IEC, but cryosurgery is significantly more effective. On the other hand, curettage may result in shorter wound healing times.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165485279"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/jdv.19322"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
