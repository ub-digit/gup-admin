However, for documents in rare scripts with few labelled training data available, current Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems are too constraining. Moreover, research on HTR often focuses on technical aspects only, and rarely puts emphasis on implementing software tools for scholars in Humanities. In this article, we describe, compare, and analyse different transcription methods for rare scripts. We evaluate their performance in a real-use case of a medieval manuscript written in the runic script (Codex Runicus) and discuss advantages and disadvantages of each method from the user perspective. From this exhaustive analysis and comparison with a fully manual transcription, we raise conclusions and provide recommendations to scholars interested in using automatic transcription tools.", "keywords": "codex runicus, handwritten text recognition tools, Historical manuscripts, human evaluation", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165660745"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1145/3519306"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
