Method: This was a longitudinal cohort study using data reported into the combined Swedish CP follow-up programme and national quality registry from October 2000 to October 2022. Walking, walking with aids, wheeled mobility, and assisted mobility defined independent or assisted mobility at home and in the community, based on the Functional Mobility Scale with additional data on wheelchair performance, were assessed. Results: There were 52 858 examinations reported for 6647 individuals with CP (age range 0\u201332 years, follow-up period 0\u201322 years). Most children and adults in Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I or II walked without assistive devices. The probability of dependence on others for mobility in the community was high for both children and adults in GMFCS levels III to V. Interpretation: Although independent mobility is vital for participation and social inclusion, many children and adults with CP are dependent on others for mobility. We recommend clinicians, together with families and individuals with CP, explore how to increase access to independent mobility from an early age and continuously throughout the life course.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167420394"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/dmcn.15731"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
