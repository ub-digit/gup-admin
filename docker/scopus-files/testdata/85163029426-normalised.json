He gives a constructively acceptable version of Kleene's computable ordinals. In fact, the Turing definition of computable functions is not needed from a constructive point of view.We give in this chapter a constructive theory of ordinals that is similar to Martin-L\u00f6f's theory, but based only on the two relations \"x \u2264 y\" and \"x < y\", i.e., without considering sequents whose intuitive meaning is a classical disjunction. In our setting, the operation \"supremum of ordinals\" plays an important role through its interactions with the relations \"x \u2264 y\" and \"x < y\". This allows us to approach as much as we may the notion of linear order when the property \"A \u2264 B or B \u2264 A\" is provable only within classical logic. Our aim is to give a formal definition corresponding to intuition, and to prove that our constructive ordinals satisfy constructively all desirable properties.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163029426"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1142/9789811245220 0012"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
