Methods: We included participants\u00a0with periodontal\u00a0examination\u00a0(n\u00a0=\u00a03633, aged: 40\u201393 years)\u00a0from\u00a0the Troms\u00f8 Study seventh survey (2015\u20132016), Norway. Periodontitis was defined according to the 2017 AAP/EFP classification system as no periodontitis, grades A, B, or C. Salivary DNA was extracted and genotyping was performed to investigate four SNPs (rs2288349, rs35474715, rs34023346, and rs10010325) in the sequence of the genes DNMT1, IDH2, TET1, and TET2. Association between SNPs and periodontitis was analyzed by logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, and smoking. Subgroup analyses on participants aged 40\u201349 years were performed. Results: In participants aged 40-49 years, homozygous carriage of minor A-allele of rs2288349 (DNMT1) was associated with decreased susceptibility to periodontitis (grade A: odds ratio [OR] 0.55; p\u00a0=\u00a00.014: grade B/C OR 0.48; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). The minor A-allele of rs10010325 (TET2) was associated with increased susceptibility to periodontitis (grade A OR 1.69; p\u00a0=\u00a00.035: grade B/C OR 1.90; p\u00a0=\u00a00.014). In the entire sample, homozygous carriage of the G-allele of rs35474715 (IDH2) was associated with having \u226424 teeth (OR 1.31; p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). Homozygous carriage of the A-allele of TET2 was associated with hs-CRP\u22653\u00a0mg/L (OR 1.37; p\u00a0=\u00a00.025) and HbA1c\u22656.5% (OR 1.62; p\u00a0=\u00a00.028). Conclusions: In this Norwegian population, there were associations between polymorphism in genes related to DNA methylation and periodontitis, tooth loss, low-grade inflammation, and hyperglycemia.", "keywords": "DNA methylation, epigenetics, periodontitis, single nucleotide polymorphism, SNPs", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164130382"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1002/JPER.23-0108"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
