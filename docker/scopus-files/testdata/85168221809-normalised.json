Individuals affected describe impairing and debilitating symptoms sometimes making it difficult to take part in work and social life. Long COVID is likely to have an impact on the work force. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore workplace factors that promote and hinder work ability and return to work among individuals with long-term effects of COVID-19. METHODS: A qualitative design was used. Data were collected by semi-structured focus group interviews and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. To increase trustworthiness, several researchers were involved in the data collection and analysis. Five focus group interviews were conducted with individuals suffering from long-term effects from COVID-19 affecting their work ability. In total, 19 individuals participated in the study, and all were working at least 50 per cent at the time of recruitment. RESULTS: Five main themes emerged from the analysis: Communication and support, Possibilities to adjust work, Acceptance of new limitations, Increased need for recovery from work and Lack of knowledge and understanding of the effects of Covid. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that it is useful to facilitate communication, support and work adjustments for individuals suffering from Long COVID. It is also important to accept limitations and fluctuations in work ability and encourage recovery during and after work.", "keywords": "Long COVID, need for recovery, qualitative research, work conditions", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168221809"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3233/WOR-220541"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
