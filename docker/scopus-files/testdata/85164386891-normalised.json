Mathematical multi-physics models have been developed to predict the development of atherosclerosis under different conditions. However, these models are typically computationally expensive. In this study, we used machine learning techniques, particularly artificial neural networks (ANN), to enhance the computational efficiency of these models. A database of multi-physics Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations was created and used for training and validating an ANN model. The model is capable of quick and accurate prediction of atherosclerosis development. A remarkable computational gain is obtained using the ANN model compared to the original FEM simulations.", "keywords": "Artificial neural networks, Atherosclerosis, Finite Element Modeling, Multi-physics", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164386891"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e17902"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
