People living in households with an income below a fixed percent of the median per-capita income and wealth below the same fixed percent of the median per-capita wealth among urban residents are deemed as relative poor. Although migrants with rural hukou living in urban China were more prone to twice poverty than urban residents in 2013, this was not generally the case in 2018. A multivariate analysis shows several factors to be related to the probability of being twice relative poor. Even considering these factors, a rural hukou status increased the probability of being twice relative poor in 2013. In contrast, such an excess risk of being twice relative poor was much lesser outspoken in middle and low-ranking cities in 2018. However, rural to urban migrants living in high-ranking cities had a somewhat higher risk of being relative poor than urban residents with the same characteristics in 2018.", "keywords": "China household income project, Poverty, Rural to urban migrants, Twice poverty, Urban China, Urban residents", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163859363"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.chieco.2023.102012"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
