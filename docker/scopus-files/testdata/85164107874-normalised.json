Methods: We studied the impact of iterative Covid-19 mRNA vaccination and hybrid immunity on antibody levels in immunosuppressed subjects. Patients with liver cirrhosis (n = 38), survivors of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) (n = 36) and patients with autoimmune liver disease (n = 14) along with healthy controls (n = 20) were monitored for SARS-CoV-2-S1 IgG after their 1st\u20133rd vaccine doses, 31 of whom became infected with the Omicron variant after the 2nd dose. Ten uninfected allo-HSCT recipients received an additional 4th vaccine dose. Results: Unexpectedly, immunosuppressed patients achieved antibody levels in parity with controls after the 3rd vaccine dose. In all study cohorts, hybrid immunity (effect of vaccination and natural infection) resulted in approximately 10-fold higher antibody levels than vaccine-induced immunity alone. Conclusions: Three doses of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine entailed high antibody concentrations even in immunocompromised individuals, and hybrid-immunity resulted further augmented levels than vaccination alone.
