To address this gap, we theorize, in the fiscal contract tradition, that property rights assigned and upheld by the state, as opposed to other political authorities, increase individual assent to taxation. We apply this argument to property rights on land in sub-Saharan-Africa, where the majority of land is governed by traditional authorities. Empirically we examine (1) the link between the state-Assinged property rights on land and assent to taxation using individual-level data from Afrobarometer, and (2) the effect of state-led formalization, measured through novel data on state-produced cadastral records, and revenue from taxes on individuals in a panel of 37 sub-Saharan African countries across 35 years. We find support for our argument that there is no taxation without state-Assigned property rights.", "keywords": "Afrobarometer, cadastre, property rights, sub-Saharan Africa, taxation", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164379634"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1017/S1744137422000406"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
