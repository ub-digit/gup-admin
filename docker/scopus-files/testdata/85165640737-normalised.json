Examples include, but are not limited to, the interchange- and spin singlet projection interactions on complete bipartite graphs. Using two instances of the representation theoretic framework of Schur\u2013Weyl duality, we can explicitly compute the free energy and other thermodynamic limits in the models we consider. This allows us to describe the phase transition, the ground-state phase diagram, and the expected structure of extremal states.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165640737"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.aam.2023.102572"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
