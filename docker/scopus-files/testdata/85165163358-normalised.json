With a focus on Angered in Gothenburg, this article analyzes the governance strategies that have been dominant, what kind of conflicts they have generated, which strategies residents in the neighborhoods have developed to resist the\u201ddevelopment\u201d and the outcome of the conflicts. Based on critical urban research and governmentality theory, we distinguish three forms of shifting responsibilization: 1) from macro- to meso-level when municipal housing companies are given the responsibility of leading partnerships with private actors and non-profit organizations in a way that involves these actors in tasks that were previously the responsibility of the state, 2) from the meso- to the micro-level when municipal housing companies shift the responsibility for renovations and development of local environments to individual tenants, 3) from the micro-level back to the meso- and macro-level when residents of million program areas resist responsibilization and demand a re-responsibilization of the municipality and the central state.", "keywords": "responsibilization, state-led gentrification, tenant organizing, territorial stigmatization, urban governance", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165163358"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.37062/sf.60.24784"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
