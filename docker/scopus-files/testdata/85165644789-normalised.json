Methods and Materials: The analysis included 623 women born in 1927 or later who had survived cancer. They all had received external radiation therapy toward the pelvic area to treat gynecologic cancers. Information from 344 women who did not undergo irradiation, matched for age and residency, was also included. Main outcome measures after the surgical procedures were the intensity scores for 5 radiation-induced intestinal syndromes: urgency-tenesmus syndrome, fecal-leakage syndrome, excessive mucus discharge, excessive gas discharge, and blood discharge. The scores were based on symptom frequencies obtained from patient-reported outcomes and on factor loadings obtained from a previously reported factor analysis. Follow-up was 2 to 15 years after radiation therapy. Results: Among survivors of cancer, intra-abdominal surgery increased the intensity of the urgency-tenesmus syndrome, the fecal-leakage syndrome, excessive gas discharge, and blood discharge but had a negligible effect on mucus discharge. Intra-abdominal surgery had an especially negative effect on the urgency-tenesmus syndrome. Although the combination of appendectomy with 1 or more other intra-abdominal surgeries resulted in the highest score for all syndromes, appendectomy alone had weak to no effect. In women who did not undergo irradiation, a similar pattern was seen, albeit with much lower scores. Conclusions: We found intra-abdominal surgery to be a risk factor among survivors of gynecologic cancer, increasing the intensity score of 4 out of 5 radiation-induced intestinal syndromes. During radiation therapy, it may be worthwhile to pay extra attention to the dose of unwanted ionizing radiation to the intestines if the patient previously has undergone intra-abdominal surgery.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165644789"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.adro.2023.101303"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
