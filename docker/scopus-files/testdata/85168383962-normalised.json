Microglia are important for antiviral defense in the brain. Here, we report that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) infection of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived microglia down-regulates expression of genes in the TREM2 pathway. TREM2 was found to be important for virus-induced IFNB induction through the DNA-sensing cGAS-STING pathway in microglia and for phagocytosis of HSV1-infected neurons. Consequently, TREM2 depletion increased susceptibility to HSV1 infection in human microglia-neuron cocultures and in the mouse brain. TREM2 augmented STING signaling and activation of downstream targets TBK1 and IRF3. Thus, TREM2 is important for the antiviral immune response in microglia. Since TREM2 loss-of-function mutations and HSV1 serological status are both linked to Alzheimer's disease, this work poses the question whether genetic or virus-induced alterations of TREM2 activity predispose to post-infection neurological pathologies.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168383962"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1126/sciadv.adf5808"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
