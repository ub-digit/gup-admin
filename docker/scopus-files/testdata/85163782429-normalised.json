Postoperative malalignment is still commonly reported after minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO). We evaluated the postoperative alignment after MIPO using a traction table with a dedicated femoral support. Methods: The study included 32 patients aged 65 years or older with distal femur fractures of all AO/OTA types 32 (c) and 33 (except 33 B3 and C3) and peri-implant fractures with stable implants. Internal fixation was achieved with MIPO using a bridge-plating construct. Bilateral computed tomography (CT) scans of the entire femur were performed postoperatively, and measurements of the uninjured contralateral side defined anatomical alignment. Due to incomplete CT scans or excessively distorted femoral anatomy, seven patients were excluded from analyses. Results: Fracture reduction and fixation on the traction table provided excellent postoperative alignment. Only one of the 25 patients had a rotational malalignment of more than 15\u00b0 (18\u00b0). Conclusions: The surgical setup for MIPO of distal femur fractures on a traction table with a dedicated femoral support facilitated reduction and fixation, resulting in a low rate of postoperative malalignment, despite a high rate of peri-implant fractures, and could be recommended for surgical treatment of distal femur fractures.", "keywords": "bone misalignment, femur fracture, fracture fixation, fracture osteosynthesis, internal, minimally invasive surgical procedure, operating table, orthopedic surgical procedure", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163782429"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/jcm12124044"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
