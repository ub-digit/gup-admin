In this chapter, we embark on an analysis of how a series of crises and their management has been affecting EU asylum policies, and more specifically how the discursive construction of solidarity, a cornerstone of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and a core value of international asylum law,has been evolving within these policies. Our analysis demonstrates how the governance of asylum in the EU has shifted towards more restriction and less solidarity both with refugees and amongst Member States in the context of emergency man- agement.We focus on the shifting perspectives on solidarity between 2015 and 2022 and trace how the concept of solidarity continues to evolve in the European governance of asylum. The analysis culminates in a discussion of the Temporary Protection Directive, the recent activation of which has once more shed light on different EU actors'and member states'answers to the question of who deserves solidarity in the EU and for how long, illuminating important aspects of racial discrimination and temporariness.", "keywords": "Asylum, CEAS, Fortress Europe, Refugee crisis, Solidarity", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167355953"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1515/9783110790337-012"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
