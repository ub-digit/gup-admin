This study aims to develop and evaluate an online hearing loss prevention program; and examine its influence on the participants\u2019 use of hearing protection, hearing loss prevention knowledge, attitude towards noise, and program useability and adherence. The study was conducted in the county of V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland, Sweden, from March through October 2021. The program included four modules focused on hearing and hearing loss prevention and was accessible to the participants for four weeks. In total, 75 participants completed the program which was evaluated using the Youth Attitude to Noise Scale and four additional self-designed questionnaires. The questionnaires were deployed before and immediately after program completion. The findings indicate that the program may influence the participants\u2019 attitudes toward noise and the use of hearing protection. The participants who completed the program perceived high useability and increased hearing loss prevention knowledge. This program is most needed to promote healthy hearing. Future studies should target specific groups with this program and evaluate its long-term effects.", "keywords": "Hearing conservation, Hearing loss prevention, Listening habits, Online hearing rehabilitation, Online intervention", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163497858"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.pmedr.2023.102298"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
