Design: Synovial fluid from osteoarthritis (OA, n \u200b= \u200b25) and knee-injury (n \u200b= \u200b13) patients, a synovial fluid pool (SF-control) and purified aggrecan, were chondroitinase digested and together with CS- and HA-standards fluorophore labelled prior to quantitative HPLC analysis. N-glycan profiles of synovial fluid and aggrecan were assessed by mass spectrometry. Results: Unsaturated uronic acid and sulfated-N-acetylgalactosamine (\u0394UA-GalNAc4S and \u0394UA-GalNAc6S) contributed to 95% of the total CS-signal in the SF-control sample. For HA and the CS variants in SF-control the intra- and inter-experiment coefficient of variation was between 3\u201312% and 11\u201319%, respectively; tenfold dilution gave recoveries between 74 and 122%, and biofluid stability test (room temperature storage and freeze-thaw cycles) showed recoveries between 81 and 140%. Synovial fluid concentrations of the CS variants \u0394UA-GalNAc6S and \u0394UA2S-GalNAc6S were three times higher in the recent injury group compared to the OA group, while HA was four times lower. Sixty-one different N-glycans were detected in the synovial fluid samples, but there were no differences in levels of N-glycan classes between patient groups. The CS-profile (levels of \u0394UA-GalNAc4S and \u0394UA-GalNAc6S) in synovial fluid resembled that of purified aggrecan from corresponding samples; the contribution to the N-glycan profile in synovial fluid from aggrecan was low. Conclusions: The HPLC-assay is suitable for analyzing CS variants and HA in synovial fluid samples, and the GAG-pattern differs between OA and recently knee injured subjects.", "keywords": "Chondroitin sulfate, HPLC, Mass spectrometry, N-Glycan, Synovial fluid", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162537246"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.ocarto.2023.100380"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
