However, they are also vulnerable to threats such as fire or flooding and can fail to respond or evacuate adequately due to unpreparedness and lack of evacuation measures. The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction has emphasised the importance of partnerships and capacity building in disaster response. One effective way to improve and develop disaster response is through exercises that focus on collaboration and leadership. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of using the 3-level collaboration (3LC) exercise in developing collaboration and leadership in districts in Thailand, using the concept of flexible surge capacity (FSC) and its collaborative tool during a hospital evacuation simulation. Methods: A mixed-method cross-sectional study was conducted with 40 participants recruited from disaster-response organisations and communities. The data from several scenario-based simulations were collected according to the collaborative elements (Command and control, Safety, Communication, Assessment, Triage, Treatment, Transport), in the disaster response education, \u201cMajor Incident Medical Management and Support\u201d using self-evaluation survey pre- and post-exercises, and direct observation. Results: The 3LC exercise effectively facilitated participants to gain a mutual understanding of collaboration, leadership, and individual and organisational flexibility. The exercise also identified gaps in communication and the utilisation of available resources. Additionally, the importance of early community engagement was highlighted to build up a flexible surge capacity during hospital evacuation preparedness. Conclusions: the 3LC exercise is valuable for improving leadership skills and multiagency collaboration by incorporating the collaborative factors of Flexible Surge Capacity concept in hospital evacuation preparedness.", "keywords": "3-level collaboration exercise, Disaster partnership, Flexible surge capacity, Hospital evacuations, Leadership, Preparedness", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168200264"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1186/s12913-023-09882-x"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60015887", "scopus-affilname": "Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bangkok", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Thailand"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Phatthranit", "first_name": "Phattharapornjaroen", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57215903751"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60111747", "scopus-affilname": "University of South-Eastern Norway", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Kongsberg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Norway"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Eric", "first_name": "Carlstr\u00f6m", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "25649181100"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60015887", "scopus-affilname": "Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bangkok", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Thailand"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Pongsakorn", "first_name": "Atiksawedparit", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56848296600"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Lina Dahl\u00e9n", "first_name": "Holmqvist", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55491509500"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60015887", "scopus-affilname": "Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bangkok", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Thailand"}], "person": [{"position": "5", "last_name": "Dhanesh", "first_name": "Pitidhammabhorn", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "8578347800"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60015887", "scopus-affilname": "Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Bangkok", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Thailand"}], "person": [{"position": "6", "last_name": "Yuwares", "first_name": "Sittichanbuncha", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "54897959900"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "7", "last_name": "Amir", "first_name": "Khorram-Manesh", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "6602425919"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
