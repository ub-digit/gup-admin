We aimed, primarily, to study the radiographic morphology of PPFFs close to a Lubinus SP2 stem. Secondarily, we analyzed whether higher reoperation rate was correlated to the revision method chosen or to the characteristics of the fracture and of the bone. Patients and methods \u2014 The study included 156 femoral fractures close to a Lubinus cemented stem. These fractures were treated in 40 hospitals in Sweden between 2006 and 2011 and were followed up until 2019. Data from the Swedish Arthroplasty Register was used. Medical records and radio-graphs were studied. The fractures were classified accord-ing to the Vancouver classification. The fracture location and anatomy were delineated. We also measured the remaining attachment index (RAI) and the canal thickness ratio. Results \u2014 Vancouver type C (n = 101) and spiral fractures (n = 67, 41 in Vancouver C and 26 in Vancouver B) were the most common fracture types. 4 fractures were avul-sion of the greater trochanter. The remaining 51 fractures occurred around the stem (B1: 25, B2: 16, and B3: 10). B fractures were more commonly reoperated on (18 of 51, 35%) than type C fractures (11 of 101, 11%, P = 0.001). In most femurs with type B3 fracture, the fracture line covered an area only around the stem, but in all B1 and in 11 of 16 B2 fractures, it was extended even distal to the stem. ORIF instead of stem revision in B2 fractures, use of short stems or plates, and inadequate reduction of the fractures were risk factors for subsequent reoperations. Conclusion \u2014 The higher reoperation rate in type B fractures, compared with fractures distal to the stem, could be caused by their higher degree of complexity and reduced capacity for healing in the region around the stem.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168625437"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.2340/17453674.2023.18263"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60104352", "scopus-affilname": "Alings\u00e5s Hospital", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Alingsas", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Ali", "first_name": "Sattar", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58545734800"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "120021748", "scopus-affilname": "Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Johan", "first_name": "K\u00e4rrholm", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7005258333"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60031699", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}, {"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "3", "last_name": "Michael", "first_name": "M\u00f6ller", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "7202473953"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60027675", "scopus-affilname": "Sahlgrenska Akademin", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "4", "last_name": "Georgios", "first_name": "Chatziagorou", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "56374422800"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
