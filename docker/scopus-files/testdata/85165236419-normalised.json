It is not clear whether concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 in the central nervous system predict later brain and cognitive changes over time nor whether this relationship is mediated by core AD biomarkers. Here, 219 cognitively healthy older adults (62\u201391 years), with baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of IL-6 and IL-8 were followed over time \u2013 up to 9 years \u2013 with assessments that included cognitive function, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and CSF measurements of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2-42) concentrations (for a subsample). Higher baseline CSF IL-8 was associated with better memory performance over time in the context of lower levels of CSF p-tau and p-tau/A\u03b2-42 ratio. Higher CSF IL-6 was related to less CSF p-tau changes over time. The results are in line with the hypothesis suggesting that an up-regulation of IL-6 and IL-8 in the brain may play a neuroprotective role in cognitively healthy older adults with lower load of AD pathology.", "keywords": "AD biomarkers, Cerebrospinal fluid, Cognitively unimpaired older adults, Interleukin-6, Interleukin-8, Longitudinal MRI", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85165236419"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.bbi.2023.06.027"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
