The values, norms and ideas concerning journalism and journalistic practice have previously been studied by journalists and journalism students around the world and in the Nordics, while the Nordic journalism educators\u2019 conceptions have remained more or less without attention. Nevertheless, journalism educators play a crucial role in defining what journalism is and what it is not, and thus largely affect future practitioners\u2019 ideas of journalism. Using a questionnaire that has been employed in previous studies, journalism educators within the academic journalism training in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden (n = 115) were surveyed in terms of their conceptions. It was found that the journalism educators, of which 35 per cent had a doctoral degree, still largely subscribe to the ideas of the welfare state. In addition, the ideas of slow, investigative, constructive and solutions-based journalism have gained high popularity among the Nordic educators, which, we argue, dovetails well with the pedagogical aims of journalism education.", "keywords": "journalism education, journalism educators, journalistic values, normativity, professional identities, the Nordic countries", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168584954"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/journalmedia3030031"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Maarit", "first_name": "Jaakkola", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "55312928000"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60032398", "scopus-affilname": "University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Jyvaskyla", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Finland"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Panu", "first_name": "Uotila", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57207935659"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
