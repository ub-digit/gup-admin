This contrasts CD169+ macrophages present in primary breast tumors (CD169+ TAMs), that correlate with a worse prognosis. We recently showed that these CD169+ TAMs were associated with tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) and Tregs in breast cancer. Here, we show that CD169+ TAMs can be monocyte-derived and express a unique mediator profile characterized by type I IFNs, CXCL10, PGE2 and inhibitory co-receptor expression pattern. The CD169+ monocyte-derived macrophages (CD169+ Mo-M) possessed an immunosuppressive function in vitro inhibiting NK, T and B cell proliferation, but enhanced antibody and IL6 secretion in activated B cells. Our findings indicate that CD169+ Mo-M in the primary breast tumor microenvironment are linked to both immunosuppression and TLS functions, with implications for future targeted Mo-M therapy.", "keywords": "B cell, breast cancer, CD169, macrophage, TLS, tolerance, type I IFN", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163983443"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3389/fimmu.2023.1180209"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
