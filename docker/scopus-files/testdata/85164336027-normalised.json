This plain language summary of an article published in Molecular Psychiatry, reviews the evidence supporting the role of the amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) pathway and its dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and highlights the rationale for drugs targeting the A\u03b2 pathway in the early stages of the disease. Why is this important? A\u03b2 is a protein fragment (or peptide) that exists in several forms distinguished by their size, shape/structure, degree of solubility and disease relevance. The accumulation of A\u03b2 plaques is a hallmark of AD. However, smaller, soluble aggregates of A\u03b2 - including A\u03b2 protofibrils - also play a role in the disease. Because A\u03b2-related disease mechanisms are complex, the diagnosis, treatment and management of AD should be reflective of and guided by up-to-date scientific knowledge and research findings in this area. This article describes the A\u03b2 protein and its role in AD, summarizing the evidence showing that altered A\u03b2 clearance from the brain may lead to the imbalance, toxic buildup and misfolding of the protein - triggering a cascade of cellular, molecular and systematic events that ultimately lead to AD. What are the key takeaways? The physiological balance of brain A\u03b2 levels in the context of AD is complex. Despite many unanswered questions, mounting evidence indicates that A\u03b2 has a central role in driving AD progression. A better understanding of the A\u03b2 pathway biology will help identify the best therapeutic targets for AD and inform treatment approaches. </sec.", "keywords": "Alzheimer's disease, amyloid beta, A\u03b2 plaques, biomarkers, dementia, protofibrils, tau", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164336027"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.2217/nmt-2022-0037"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
