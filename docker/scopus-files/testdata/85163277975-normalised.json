This research note suggests that declining quality of government increases support for populist radical right parties. Using the latest rounds of the European Quality of Government Index (EQI) survey data that sampled at the NUTS 2 regional level in France, and exploiting the fact that the French, presidential elections contained the same candidates (Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen) in 2017 and 2022, we show that regions increase their vote share for Le Pen where the quality of government decreases. We also show that this relationship holds at the individual level. Thus, supplying quality, impartial and fair public services seem to stifle demand for nativism, ethnic favoritism and authoritarianism and suppress support for the PRR party agenda.", "keywords": "Far right, France, Presidential elections, Quality of government, Voting behavior", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163277975"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.electstud.2023.102644"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
