The following article is driven by the idea that systematic qualitative visual metaphor analysis offers a fresh way of thinking through how translation situates itself in the literary field and engages the public. Drawing on archival online research, I will present a reading of images that were published between 2012 and 2017, and that are still available to be viewed online (02.02.20 18), in connection with the Leipzig Book Fair Prize. My analysis in this article will show the following: 1) book fairs are open network systems that both aim at reinforcing and renegotiating value systems; 2) translators take on different roles in this system, as agents, producers and advertisers of cultural goods; and 3) cognitive metaphor analysis is a suitable tool to expose the uneven power-relations between translation and literature. It also argues that, to surmount the challenges of archival online ethnography, metaphorical analysis needs to include other than verbal modes of representation.", "keywords": "book fairs, consecration, Leipzig Book Fair Prize, Translator visibility, visual metaphors", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85167918915"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Angela", "first_name": "K\u00f6lling", "identifiers": [{"type": "orcid", "value": "0000-0001-7116-2099"}, {"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "58535679800"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
