Inadvertently discovered adrenal lesions, adrenal incidentalomas, are reported in about one per cent of abdominal investigations. The first Swedish guidelines for the management of adrenal incidentalomas were published in 1996 and have since then been regularly revised. Still, data indicate that less than half of patients receive adequate follow-up. Here we comment on the newly updated guidelines and briefly review the recommended clinical and radiological work-up.", "keywords": null, "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85162706807"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
