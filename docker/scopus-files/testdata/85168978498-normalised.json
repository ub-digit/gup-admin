As a fundamental human personality structure, the Big-Five personality traits might significantly impact risky decision-making. The current study investigated the association between the Big-Five traits and risky decision-making among undergraduate college students. Methods: Data was collected from 251 undergraduate college students aged 18 to 25, of whom 89 were male and 164 were female. Risky decision-making was measured in a laboratory using the Iowa Gambling Task and a self-administered scale to evaluate the Big Five personality traits. Results: This study showed that agreeableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness correlated with risky decision-making. However, a significant association between risky decision-making with extraversion and openness was not identified. According to the results, men were more prone to making risky decisions than women. Conclusion: the results highlighted that personality traits influence individuals, particularly neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. The results are significant as they help us to understand how personality traits contribute to risk-taking behaviour. More investigation in this field is required, especially regarding the role of the dark personality triad in decision-making.", "keywords": "Big Five, decision-making, Iowa Gambling Task, Personality, risk-taking behaviour, risky decision-making", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168978498"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.24271/PSR.2023.387309.1263"}], "authors": [{"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60120317", "scopus-affilname": "Soran University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Soran", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Iraq"}], "person": [{"position": "1", "last_name": "Zana Hasan", "first_name": "Babakr", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "57210288766"}]}]}, {"affiliations": [{"scopus-afid": "60120317", "scopus-affilname": "Soran University", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Soran", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Iraq"}, {"scopus-afid": "60016437", "scopus-affilname": "G\u00f6teborgs Universitet", "scopus-affiliation-city": "Gothenburg", "scopus-affiliation-country": "Sweden"}], "person": [{"position": "2", "last_name": "Nabi", "first_name": "Fatahi", "identifiers": [{"type": "scopus-auth-id", "value": "8924841500"}]}]}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
