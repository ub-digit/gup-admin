However, distinguishing SAF skyrmions from their ferromagnetic counterparts using imaging techniques like magneto-optical microscopy remains challenging. While the suppressed intrinsic skyrmion Hall effect (SkHE) has been commonly used to identify SAF skyrmions, it is important to note that other factors such as defect pinning and dipolar interaction can also lead to a suppressed SkHE. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a universal identification method that can reliably differentiate SAF skyrmions from ferromagnetic ones. In this study, the generation of a SAF skyrmion within a standard SAF stack is demonstrated and its motion with almost no SkHE is investigated. Furthermore, a universal identification method is proposed wherein the application of an out-of-plane field allows the SAF skyrmion to be decoupled into two domains, which can either expand or contract with the application of an electric current. By expediting the development of a reliable means of identifying SAF skyrmions, these findings will accelerate the realization of practical applications based on these unique information carriers.", "keywords": "domain walls, interlayer exchange coupling, skyrmion Hall effect, spintronics, synthetic antiferromagnetic skyrmion", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85166207441"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1002/adfm.202303133"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
