To ensure quality of care and support new nurses, it is vital that this learning is elucidated and evaluated. Aim The aim was to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of an instrument assessing work-integrated learning for newly graduated registered nurses, the Experienced Work-Integrated Learning (E-WIL) instrument. Method: The study utilized the methodology of a survey and a cross-sectional research design. The sample consisted of newly graduated registered nurses (n = 221) working at hospitals in western Sweden. The E-WIL instrument was validated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results: The majority of the study participants were female, the average age was 28 years, and participants had an average of five months' experience in the profession. The results confirmed the construct validity of the global latent variable E-WIL, \u201cTransforming previous notions and new contextual knowledge into practical meaning,\u201d including six dimensions representing work-integrated learning. The factor loadings between the final 29 indicators and the six factors ranged from 0.30 to 0.89, and between the latent factor and the six factors from 0.64 to 0.79. The indices of fit indicated satisfactory goodness-of-fit and good reliability in five dimensions with values ranging from \u03b1 = 0.70 to 0.81, except for one dimension showing a slightly lower reliability, \u03b1 = 0.63, due to the low item number. Confirmatory factor analysis also confirmed two second-order latent variables, \u201cPersonal mastering of professional roles\u201d with 18 indicators, and \u201cAdapting to organisational requirements\u201d with 11 indicators. Both showed satisfactory goodness-of-fit, and factor loading between indicators and the latent variables ranged from 0.44 to 0.90 and from 0.37 to 0.81, respectively. Conclusion: The validity of the E-WIL instrument was confirmed. All three latent variables could be measured in their entirety, and all dimensions could be used separately for the assessment of work-integrated learning. The E-WIL instrument could be useful for healthcare organisations when the goal is to assess aspects of newly graduated registered nurses' learning and professional development.", "keywords": "assessment instrument, Confirmatory factor analysis, newly graduated nurses, nursing, professional development, registered nurses, transition, work-integrated learning, workplace learning", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163013113"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1016/j.nedt.2023.105889"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
