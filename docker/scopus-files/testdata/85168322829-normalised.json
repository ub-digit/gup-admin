While earlier research tends to treat member states as a collective yielding influence on supranational institutions, we unpack this collective to explore differentiated supranational influence. To this end, the article makes three contributions. First, it develops a method for measuring differentiated supranational influence that makes it possible to identify which member states give ground when a supranational institution is influential. Second, it theorizes the sources of differentiated supranational influence, arguing that states are more likely to accommodate a supranational institution when they are more dependent on the resources of this institution. Third, it illustrates the usefulness of this approach empirically through an analysis of the influence of the European Commission in European Union bargaining. The analysis suggests that our approach can measure and explain differentiated supranational influence under conditions of both heightened crisis and everyday politics.", "keywords": "bargaining, European Commission, European Union, International organizations, supranational influence", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85168322829"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/1475-6765.12620"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
