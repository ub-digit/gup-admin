Tumor cells spread from the ovary or the fallopian tube into the abdominal cavity, which is commonly accompanied with massive ascites production. The ascites represents a unique peritoneal liquid tumor microenvironment with the presence of both tumor and immune cells, including cytotoxic lymphocytes. We characterized lymphocytes in ascites from patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Our data reveal the presence of NK and CD8+ T lymphocytes expressing CD103 and CD49a, which are markers of tissue residency. Moreover, these cells express high levels of the inhibitory NKG2A receptor, with the highest expression level detected on tissue-resident NK cells. Lymphocytes with these features were also present at the primary tumor site. Functional assays showed that tissue-resident NK cells in ascites are highly responsive towards ovarian tumor cells. Similar results were observed in an in vivo mouse model, in which tissue-resident NK and CD8+ T cells were detected in the peritoneal fluid upon tumor growth. Together, our data reveal the presence of highly functional lymphocyte populations that may be targeted to improve immunotherapy for patients with ovarian cancer.", "keywords": "NK cells, NKG2A, ovarian cancer, tissue-resident lymphocytes", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164915711"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.3390/cancers15133362"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
