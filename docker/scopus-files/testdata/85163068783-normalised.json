Methods: We measured longitudinal changes in plasma amyloid-beta (A\u03b2)42/40 ratio, pTau181, pTau231, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in a cohort of older adults at risk of AD (n\u00a0=\u00a0373 total, n\u00a0=\u00a0229 with A\u03b2 and tau positron emission tomography [PET] scans) considering genetic and demographic factors as possible modifiers of these markers\u2019 progression. Results: A\u03b242/40 ratio concentrations decreased, while NfL and GFAP values increased over the 4-year follow-up. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 carriers showed faster increase in plasma pTau181 than non-carriers. Older individuals showed a faster increase in plasma NfL, and females showed a faster increase in plasma GFAP values. In the PET subsample, individuals both A\u03b2-PET and tau-PET positive showed faster plasma pTau181 and GFAP increase compared to PET-negative individuals. Discussion: Plasma markers can track biological change over time, with plasma pTau181 and GFAP markers showing longitudinal change in individuals with preclinical AD. Highlights: Longitudinal increase of plasma pTau181 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) can be measured in the preclinical phase of AD. Apolipoprotein E\u00a0\u03b54 carriers experience faster increase in plasma pTau181 over time than non-carriers. Female sex showed accelerated increase in plasma GFAP over time compared to males. A\u03b242/40 and pTau231 values are already abnormal at baseline in individuals with both amyloid and tau PET burden.", "keywords": "Alzheimer's disease, A\u03b2, biomarker, PET, plasma, pTau", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85163068783"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1002/alz.13318"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
