The current work provides 10-year updated prevalence estimates for these food allergens. A protocol was registered on PROSPERO before starting the research (reference number CRD42021266657). Six databases were searched for studies published 2012\u20132021, added to studies published up to 2012, resulting in a total of 93 studies. Most studies were graded as at moderate risk of bias. The overall pooled estimates for all age groups of self-reported lifetime prevalence were as follows: cow's milk (5.7%, 95% confidence interval 4.4\u20136.9), egg (2.4%, 1.8\u20133.0), wheat (1.6%, 0.9\u20132.3), soy (0.5%, 0.3\u20130.7), peanut (1.5%, 1.0\u20132.1), tree nuts (0.9%, 0.6\u20131.2), fish (1.4%, 0.8\u20132.0) and shellfish (0.4%, 0.3\u20130.6). The point prevalence of food challenge-verified allergy were as follows: cow's milk (0.3%, 0.1\u20130.5), egg (0.8%, 0.5\u20131.2), wheat (0.1%, 0.01\u20130.2), soy (0.3%, 0.1\u20130.4), peanut (0.1%, 0.0\u20130.2), tree nuts (0.04%, 0.02\u20130.1), fish (0.02%, 0.0\u20130.1) and shellfish (0.1%, 0.0\u20130.2). With some exceptions, the prevalence of allergy to common foods did not substantially change during the last decade; variations by European regions were observed.", "keywords": "epidemiology, Europe, food allergy, sensitization, systematic review", "publication_identifiers": [{"identifier_code": "scopus-id", "identifier_value": "85164364017"}, {"identifier_code": "doi", "identifier_value": "10.1111/all.15801"}], "source": "scopus", "attended": false}}
